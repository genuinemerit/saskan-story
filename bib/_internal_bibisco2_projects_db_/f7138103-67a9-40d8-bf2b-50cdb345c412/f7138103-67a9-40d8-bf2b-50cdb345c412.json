of Location: Khaliro</p><p>Type of Location: Old Fatunik River Town</p><p><u>Role in Story</u></p><p><br></p><p>Khaliro is the largest town and an important citadel in the Khalo province, which is a major agricultural and fishing area along the Pavan River, as well as a manufacturing and services hub for the Fatunik provinces between the two rivers.</p><p><br></p><p>With its proximity to Qurol, Pavol and Borded, it one of the most cosmopolitan of the Fatunik towns, despite its nearness also to the Center of Authority at Beshquohuk.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><u>Languages</u></p><p>Eibar is by far the dominant language, with only a few inflections distinguishing the traditional local accent from 'proper' Old Eibar.</p><p>Given the town's prominent place on the river Pavan, many visitors pass through via river traffic. Those from the West are mostly from Qurol, Borded and Mabhakol, with the occasional Eelani and other westerners.&nbsp;</p><p>Those going up river from the east are usually Eibar-speaking Fatunik traders, with a smattering of Outerlanders speaking Sogomsh.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><u>Demographics</u></p><p>Khaliro is cosmopolitan in the sense that it has a small permanent Rider population of non-believers, as well as some immigrants from the Outerlands, whose devotion to the Fatunik Dominion is well know to be less than strong.</p><p>There are also regular visitors from the Dauni Vakasaqua farming collectives south of the Settan, who regularly come to share knowledge, trade seeds and roots, and advise on agricultural matters.</p><p>The Town Authority prides itself on being civil and hospitable to these populations, though it keeps a close eye on them and requires them to reside in specific sections of the town.</p><p>Like all Fatunik towns south of the Pavan, non-huum sints are not permitted to reside in the town except in cases where they are registered to work as servants, just as they can work as farmhands in the surrounding countryside.</p><p>There is a substantially larger class of wealthy huum in Khaliro, as opposed to many other Fatunik towns.&nbsp;They have leading positions in the Fatunik guilds and/or come from old, wealthy and influential broods, or are high-ranking Scribes, Candle-makers or other high-ranking Tagabant who, due to their status, dress fancifully and present their gender openly. This makes Khaliro quite distinctive.&nbsp; The rich also tend to take on rabbit-sints as servants.</p><p><u><br></u></p><p><u>History</u></p><p>One of the oldest Fatunik towns, Khaliro was a critical original fortification protecting Fatunik settlements south of the Pavan and east of the Borda Woods. Its oldest construction sites date back almost 3,700 turns. Parts of its walls are over 2,000 turns old.</p><p>Khaliro was founded 1,000 turns before Pavol.&nbsp;</p><p>It is credited with being the bastion of Fatunik huum forces during the Great Eelani War, which concluded about 1,200 years ago with the defeat of the Eelani and the demarcation of the provincial borders between Fatunik and Rider-affiliated domains.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><u>Physical, Economic and/or Cultural Details</u></p><p><u>Thematic Tones / Feelings of the Place</u></p><p><br></p><p>Among the large Dominion towns, only Juuj and Eibar are older than Khaliro and only Beshquohuk is larger than Khaliro. It is about the same size as Borded.&nbsp;</p><p>One feels the antiquity of the town around every corner. The stones are deeply worn and smoothed. Not an inch of the town is undeveloped or undecorated. Every building and street melds into the next.</p><p>The walls of Khaliro are legendary. They have withstood countless assaults from Wesshewen raiders -- and others -- over more than two millennia. During the Great Eelani War, the westerners were never able to breach them.</p><p>Enormously thick, the walls of Khaliro have been expanded and reinforced time after time. They contain a fearsome armory within their cavernous mazes.&nbsp;</p><p>The deep tympanic rumblings of movements within the walls add to the mystique of Khaliro. Artistic depictions of its walls, or use of the Eibar rune for \"Kh\" are popular motifs throughout the Dominion for Tagabant units.</p><p>To be as strong, as undefeated, as solid as Khaliro is a standard Fatunik meme.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br></p>","location":"the Town","nation":"Fatunik Dominion","state":"Khalo","images":[],"characters":3930,"lastsave":"2023-03-19T00:29:06.150Z","position":1,"status":"todo","words":659,"meta":{"revision":46,"created":1679178008490,"version":0,"updated":1679185746150},"$loki":1}],"idIndex":[1],"binaryIndices":{},"constraints":null,"uniqueNames":[],"transforms":{},"objType":"locations","dirty":false,"cachedIndex":null,"cachedBinaryIndex":null,"cachedData":null,"adaptiveBinaryIndices":true,"transactional":false,"cloneObjects":false,"cloneMethod":"parse-stringify","asyncListeners":false,"disableMeta":false,"disableChangesApi":true,"disableDeltaChangesApi":true,"autoupdate":false,"serializableIndices":true,"disableFreeze":true,"ttl":null,"maxId":1,"DynamicViews":[],"events":{"insert":[],"update":[],"pre-insert":[],"pre-update":[],"close":[],"flushbuffer":[],"error":[],"delete":[null],"warning":[null]},"changes":[],"dirtyIds":[],"isIncremental":false},{"name":"notes","data":[{"description":"<p>In each scene, ask:<br></p><p>- Did something funny happen?
