==INSTALL==
Put the folder here:

...AppData\Roaming\Wonderdraft\assets\MyAssets\sprites\symbols

You can rename "MyAssets" to whatever you want. Mine is named "MyAssets" because...well, there my assets lol.

==Note==
These symbols are meant to be painted colored. The shading makes it pretty easy to follow (almost paint by numbers). Keep in mind the "Rainshadow Effect". The slopes closest to shore are usually more heavily vegitated/lush, with the backside of the mountains less so.

If you find any issues with the assets or have suggestions/comments, you can reach out to me on my Patreon (www.patreon.com/cg2a).

And thank you for your support! It's much appreciated.
