NOVEL STANDARD MANUSCRIPT FORMAT
       by Forename Surname

Part One
Chapter One
Standard manuscript format is often required for novels so that work can easily be read by editors. It allows editors to estimate word count and determine roughly how many pages will be required to produce a book using the page size, style and font used by their house. This PDF file was generated using Scrivener's Compile feature and was created using the "Novel (with Parts)" project template.
Manuscripts for full-length novels require a separate title page. The author's name, address, telephone number and e-mail address should be shown in the upper-left corner of the title page, single-spaced. The title of the story should appear in all-caps about half-way down the page. The author's name follows the title on the by-line as the author wants it to appear when published. A real name or pseudonym may be used
Surname / TITLE / 1

and may include initials, actual given name or professional designation.
Surname / TITLE / 2

Chapter Two
All text should be double-spaced and left-justified with a ragged right margin. Paragraphs should be indented by about five spaces (half an inch) and not separated by an additional blank line. (It used to be traditional to separate each sentence with two spaces, but in these days of word processors this is now less common.)
A 12-point font such as Courier, Times New Roman or Arial should be used throughout. In Scrivener, however, you can write using any font and formatting you choose--the options in Compile can be used to change the formatting in the compiled document. In the "Novel" project template, the Compile settings will deal with changing the font and formatting to those required for standard manuscript format.
Top, bottom, left and right margins should all be approximately one inch, not allowing for the page header. Each
Surname / TITLE / 3

page except for the title page should include a header comprising the author's real surname, the title of the work (or a key word from the title) in capitals, and the page number. In Scrivener, all of this is handled for you by the "Manuscript" Compile formats.
#
Scene breaks are indicated with the hash character. Do
not simply add an extra line space as this can be missed by the typesetter. The "Separators" pane of Scrivener's Compile sheet can handle this for you if you are writing each scene as a separate text document. In general, this will be handled by Compile in Scrivener, however, so that you can either leave empty lines in the text (and Scrivener will insert the hash character during Compile) or use different documents for different sections (and Scrivener will add the hash between them).
Some editors and publishers prefer emphasis to be indicated by underlining rather than italics. In Scrivener, this conversion can be handled by Compile. The "Manuscript (Courier)" Compile format will convert italics to underlines, whereas the "Manuscript (Times)" format will not.
Surname / TITLE / 4

Part Two
                         Chapter Three
Begin each new chapter on a new page like this with the chapter number about a third of the way down the page. In Scrivener, this can all be dealt with in the Compile settings. In Scrivener, all of this is handled automatically by the "Manuscript" compile formats.
Although it is often said that writers should not use the word-count features of their computers to determine the number of words in a manuscript, most publishers and editors will happily accept a word processor word count these days. In Scrivener, you can insert a word count of your manuscript by using Edit &gt; Insert &gt; Draft Word Count (for a manuscript, you may wish to have the word count rounded to the nearest 100, in which case select Edit &gt; Insert &gt; Draft Word Count &gt; Rounded To Nearest 100--this feature is used on the title page of this
Surname / TITLE / 5

manuscript, in fact).
Note that the actual word count will not be inserted, but
a tag that will be substituted for the word count upon export. In reality, the formatting of a manuscript is often only really crucial when submitting directly to a publisher--first time novelists will usually submit to an agent first, and agents are often less picky about format and will point you in the right direction before submitting your work to a publisher.

            <Text>Waleran Turnkey Tanakaraka 
32 seasons • from the Uitibarbo

Role in Story
A guide and story-teller. A cohort of Barfalot and other key players. Provides the perspective of a traditional Barbasol astrologer with deep knowledge of the southern traditions and languages.
Goal
Provide the Barbasol perspective and bring the non-Kahila southerners into the story.

Get a deeper dive into the musical/bard traditions of the lands.

Physical Description
Tall, angular.  Always seems to be reading something, consulting charts/manuals, etc. 
Personality
Verbose, a bit of a stereotype of an overly-educated fool. Has a very high opinion of self and like-minded or seemingly like-minded folk. Nevertheless, is entirely capable of helping in a fight, especially through the use of mildly-advanced technology and weapons. 
Occupation
Has elementary knowledge of astronomy and mathematics, but it is warped by his strong belief in astrology and a system of fortune-telling that combines astronomical observations with calculations and chanting/meditation. Well-known especially for facility in devining the meaning of “falling stars” and “fast wanderers”. (Which we will eventually find out are mostly spaceships and satellites moving around in the outer atmosphere.)

Habits/Mannerisms
Very fond of Terrapin culture. Vegetarian.  Intensely interested in written materials. An expert in the southern languages, including Doremah.  Very fond of music and song but not a very good singer or player; as a result is a strong sponsor/fan of those who are, c.f. Barakay and Lukando.
Background
Originally from the “wild lands” of Uitibarbo, considers Terpinol home. Has been to the Land of the Komexenon at least once. Has sailed on the Aran Sea and visited Aranzen. Is well-travelled.  Devout member of a Barbasol Earth-Soul cult, but also a leading [Star-Gazer] theologian/analyst.  Is utterly clueless as to the true nature of the enclosure, but has a fascinating grasp of the metaphysics of it. 
Internal Conflicts
Deeply cynical despite a fairly up-beat personality. Does not trust/is not satisfied with any of the main or secondary ‘powers’, including the so-called Wind Lords, the Eelan, the octo-folk and so on.  Has a nagging feeling that nobody really knows what is really going on (and is right about this).   A bit of a pacifist at heart, Waleran is conflicted about having to support / work with militants like Mur’ray.
External Conflicts
One of the players being actively monitored by an Agent, Waleran will occasionally get an  “external assist” in a divination in order to achieve a desired outcome.  This can contradict establishing stargazing algorithms, which forces Waleran to start to develop a more scientific outlook — which is fundamentally at odds with both Barbasol and Star-Gazer theologies. 
As a well-known Stargazer, Waleran is pre-sanctioned by the Heliocastron and has to be careful when traveling in the inner Northern areas.

            <Title>Scene 4</Title>
            <Synopsis>In an Octopuses Garden</Synopsis>
            <Text>The Jax took them down an ill-lit hallway to an ornately-carved door.  First using a combination of small keys on a lock that was hard to see, then Kirill tapped on a series of the decorative dentils, spoke a brief enchantment, something like “Vwah! La! Say! Saa!”, and they heard three large bolts unbolting.  The door slowly opened inwards.
Once they were beyond the door, Master Kirill told the Lookie to get lost, then settled onto a small ornate chair and motioned for Barfalot to make himself comfortable on a pile of pillows and throw-rugs. After circling around a few times, to get a good look at the place and because that’s what always felt like the right thing to do before sitting down, Barfalot settled himself with one rather large and, if you looked carefully, somewhat pointy, ear cocked in Kirill’s direction, his eyes and especially his nose taking in what he soon grasped to be rather unusual surroundings.
Stepping through the door, they’d left behind a large, noisy, ill-lit, smoky room filled with an eclectic mix of sints touching every data point on the spectrum from puros to impuros, Barfalot saw they had stepped into a quiet, tranquil space lit by an ambient greenish-blue hue.  He was soon entranced by the the sound of quietly gurgling water.

Once his eyes adjusted to the light, he saw they were surrounded on three sides by a see-through enclosure, with walls of a solid but clearly transparent and largely scent-free substance.  Could it be ice? 
The transparent walls were neither freezing-cold nor melting. They were, however,  holding back a sizable body of water.  On the other side of the ice-but-not-really-ice walls were varieties of shell-like enclosures, and what Barfalot recognized from his journeys on the Kerbshana Sea as coral structures.  A light source emanated from within the watery realm.  
Kirill said nothing while Barfalot sniffed out his surroundings.  As he surveyed the scene, the old song catcher searched his mind to recall a word he’d heard used for the first time during a retreat, many moon-turns ago, with a small team of mostly puros adepts from the Society for the Reinvention of Aesthetics. They’d spent several days and nights, adorned only in simple purple cloaks, discussing and debating a proposed “revolutionary strategy for developing fully autonomous inter-sentient art forms as a means towards strengthening the post-structural transformation of private and inter-subjective spaces with an eye towards developing a popular communicative rationality that would, in time, lead to...”
Well, let’s just say, to good things for all the sints. At least that was the idea. 
Barfalot noticed something moving about in the water, half-hidden among the shells and coral.  It had tentacles.  Much like those of the octo-boys at the bar.  

“This is where the barkippers live when they’re not working,” Kirill squeaked. “As far as I can tell, only the males leave the water-garden. The females never do.  That’s their deal. I call it the water-garden because...”
“Ah! Yes. It’s an aquarium!”, Baraflot interrupted in iBark, remembering at last the ancient word he’d been searching for.  
“Ah. Kwaa. What?” 
“It’s a word from one of the Ancient Tongues,” Barfalot explained, “Aqua meant water and Rium meant, we believe, something like a watch-hold. So an ‘aqau-rium’ is where they imprisoned water-dwelling creatures, either for amusement or in preparation for slaughtering and eating them.”  
“Oh, sure, like a fish tank. We have one out back.  We keep the eatables from the Bloo in there until we’re ready to serve them to our flesh-eating customers. Mostly we buy from Beaverton. Some from indie flesh-hunters.” Kirill matter-of-factly explained.
Barfalot, who, after a great deal of internal grappling with ethics, had abandoned flesh-eating many turns ago, looked down sadly for a few moments, but didn’t say anything. 
“Well, yes, but an aquarium was... well, evidently it had magical walls... like this material... a watery enclosure that you could see through. I had always thought that was just ancient myth.  But here it is.”  
Barfalot didn’t bother to share how one of the SRA adept had also posited that aquarium “was a potentially useful metaphor for developing an modified ontology that opens a space to create inter-subjective ironic distances for bridging communicative gaps regarding power and equality without over-disrupting deeply-programmed structural-identity concepts of terra/torial permanence”. 
“Yeah, dunno how they did that,” Kirill said. “Octopoo multi-brains, you know.  Whatever.  They got it set up.  Super-duper smarty pants of the sea and all that. Cost me a pretty bucket of kubytes, I’ll tell ya that. But worth it. Best barkippers in the business.  Keep to themselves too.  Not always up in your business like some busy-bodies.”
He stared rather dramatically at Barfalot at that point.
Choosing not to take the bait, Barfalot looked around some more and said, “So you call it a water-garden, eh? That makes sense. I suppose.  Hmmmmmm. Yes. Because it’s like being under the sea, isn’t it? In an octopus’s garden.” 
Barfalot stared at his host with an quizzical look on his face.

Kirill stood up and tapped his glowy stick on the floor boards as he spoke, betraying some impatience with Barfalot’s tendency toward analyzing everything to within an inch of its life, then making obscure jokes that nobody got.
“Anyway. You said you had something important to tell me?”
“First. Remind me. You are pledged to the sacred bonds of the Annaka Intimi, are you not, old friend?”, Barfalot asked.
Sitting back down but with is back held up very straight, in a commanding manner, Kirill said very quietly and entirely seriously, “You know very well that I am.” 
“And as the Master of the clan of the Manifold Ways, not to mention as proprietor of this renowned establishment, you have a large community to whom you are responsible as well.”
“Yes, that is also true. And I am dues-paying member of the Free Innkeepers Guild too. And if you must know, I supply the good s’lah to the basherbazooki barracks on the sly as well.  And at a handy profit.  Any other nosy questions?”
“The Free Innkeepers Guild charges no dues payments that I am aware of,” Barfalot growled, a bit menacingly.
“Figure of speech. Figure of speech.  Moons and stars. Wanderers and bards.  You don’t have to be so freaking literal about everything. What is this, some Beaverton inquisition into my business affairs? Damn Mages.”
“As I’m sure you are well aware,” Barfalot lied, ”there is no such things as a Mages Guild. And you know very well that I am a rationalist and make an honest living with the Bards.”
“As the ancients said, ‘Potayto. Potahto.’ All right then. Let’s not play word games.  To be precise, I am a senior consultant to the eastern free innkeepers bookkeepers fraction of the Free Hostelries Cooperative Council. So. As I am sure you know, that means I pretty much have to provide free goodies to whatever Riders show up at my door.  So.  Pretty much the same thing as paying dues, innit?  Wouldn’t you say?”
“Fair enough. I see what you mean,” the old philosopher concurred. “It is your role as an, err, umm, let’s say as an honest broker, and as head of an important sint-clan, that interests me more than your fealty to Borded.”
“Fealty? Fealty! Now, that’s a bit strong, Barfie. I know the old songs as well as you do. I have plenty of friends in Beaverton and even a few acquaintances in the ALF too, as I am sure you are aware. But. Submitted.  Yes. Cross-born. True. As charged. I supposed I do prefer doing business with the Riders rather than moons-forsaken, sun-sucking Heliops whenever possible.  But ‘fealty’? Really?...”

Barfalot trained his soulful brown eyes upon his diminutive Gekkota friend’s big pupils, whose wide-awake nature was so characteristic of the Squamata order.  He pondered for a while life without eyelids, trying to have compassion for what it must be like to never close ones eyes.  
He blinked automatically himself when he saw Master Kirill, seemingly without thinking about it twice, lick his eyeballs clean.  
“Holy Jook”, Barfalot thought to himself, “this little guy could never pass for puros.”
In a quiet voice, using the Beetish argot lest any of those octo-lasses had ways of listening in to their conversation through the bizarrely warm ice, Barfalot told Master Kirill what he’d learned about the so-called Wind Riders.  
He confirmed that the longstanding rumors were, in fact, true. 
Or true-ish at any rate.
More pertinent to a confidential chat with a fearsome leader of one of the larger basimi guilds, he described what he’d discovered in the ancient ruins far to the South, deep in the fabled Grumsh-speaking Lands of Groomsh: what appeared to be the apparatus for communicating with flying machines. 
As he’d hoped, the potential for profits to be acquired from the combination of these two tales quickly caught Master Kirill’s rapt attention. 

As they talked on into the night, their good s’lah being refreshed from time to time by the Jax, and just as Barfalot had hoped it would, the possibilities for serious political and cultural impacts resulting from these discoveries, if certain arrangements could be taken and various alliances forged, also began to take shape in the mind of the Supreme Warden of the Annaka Intimi.</Text>

            <Title>Bordaloon</Title>
            <Text>Bordaloon
West of the Ring, north of Eelan, east of the southern Krunkinotto

Role in Story
“The Land of Men” in a way.  Part of the loyal Rider countryside. Prosperous.  Refines and manufactures goods. Supplies both Borded and Qurol. But also exposed to the “new thinking” of the Weyrlands. As the epic unfolds, the Rider faction who break away are centered in Bordaloon.

Ethics. Sacrifice. 
Related Characters
Main towns are:

 Mabhakol. Very high tower, well-fortified. Lots of manufacturing of all types. Built next to an active and deep mine. Overlooks the Northern River just before it flows under the Ring. 

Borded, the great Rider capital, sits on the Ring just on the other side of the River, both of which make up borders to this province. While formally it sits astride 2 other provinces, Borded is the undoubted metropolitan capital of Bordaloon.
Season
I think of Bordaloon as often a bit dark and gloomy in its mid-section, more like Eelan and the Weyrlands to the south, and a kind of arid plain to the north, but increasingly well-irrigated the closer one gets to the river. 

Unique Features
A very large peak defines its western border with the Krunkinotto range.
A large military encampment just over the border with Mabalbesq, north of the river. 
Description
In many ways the Rider’s “homeland”.  Many ring riders and others who work directly for the council in Borded hail from this region.

It helps to identify words associated with moods, with a spectrum for most/least happy.

Kind of building on this idea, I am thinking it might be useful, interesting, to make a short list of words defining the mood for a given chapter or section.


Some musical terms I might like to play with:

Beat - Beet
Cadence
Deceptive cadence
Candenza — an improvised cadence
Tessitura — range
Song cycles
Rubato — change in pace for dramatic, emotional effect
Obbligato — an extended solo song
Presto — go fast

West of the Ring, south of Bordaloon, east of The Weyrlands

Role in Story
Provide some sense of the older inhabitants of the region, who are neither Helioptic, nor Barba, nor Kahila, nor part of the “new/high/hidden” thinking found in the Weyrlands. I’d like for the mines and hills of Eelan to provide in some way the foundation of the musical character of the region. 
These are country/hill people, hard working miners, not easily impressed, fond of their folkways.

Duty. Tradition
Related Characters


Season


Unique Features
Only one well-kept road through the region, it directly connects Eelan to Bordakal in the Borda Woods and through a much more circuitous route to Mabhakol in Bordaloon. A smaller, more difficult road connects Eelan to Qurol, just inside the Ring and on the Northern River.  These are mainly commercial connections. Eelaners seldom leave the region.

Description
The region is loosely allied to the Riders, but does business with the Heliops too.  The folk-religion involves a kind of worship of “ancient artifacts”, but without any hidden meaning, just a kind of ecstatic belief in redemption-from-toil and talismans against re-emergence of catastrophe. Americans might read it as a kind of Baptist faith, de-centralized, congregational, anti-hierarchical, but has some aspects of saint/guru practice also in the manner of Sufis, Sikhs and some Hindus.

Sights
Eelan is the main town in the province of Eelan. Several large mining operations in the region.  Many mining roads throughout the region.

Sounds
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho.  Work, work, work. The region will remind some readers of a kingdom of the dwarves.
Smelting, hammering, carts rolling. Lots of singing to go with it.

            <Title>Mantemar</Title>
            <Text>Mantemar names the Enclosure. It is like a collection of Continents and some very large islands, but beyond it is only The Edge of the World. The name “Mantemar” refers to fact that all land is surrounded by the world-ocean. “Mantemar” is used in the sense of “the world” as well as of “the ocean”.  

In this world, there is a widely-held belief that the lands and lives of Mantemar are “enclosed” by a higher power or powers.  Sun-worshippers center this belief in a power residing in the Sun, while so-called Moons-worshippers center their beliefs in powers residing away from the Sun, such as in the Two Moons, in the Wanderers (planets), in various configurations of Stars, or in the Beyond. 

A smaller set of believers state that life and existence is itself literally an illusion in the sense that some greater power has imagined, dreamed or somehow caused to come into self-consciousness the lands and beings of Mantemar. 

A variation on that belief is a materialist version which considers that the lands and lives of Mantemar are some kind of experiment being conducted by unknown forces outside of the Enclosure.  

This last belief is closest to the truth. In fact, the planet experienced a bad case of the Catastrophicals and nearly wrecked itself. As in so many other cases, the Agency had to come along and do some engineering to rehabilitate the place. These “evolutionary” tweaks, initiated thousands of years ago, were intended to help prevent the worst outbreaks of catastrophe from happening again.  So you see the effects of strong constraints in place on burning fossil fuels, on letting inter-species imbalances go too far, on rapid transit and long-range communications, and on over-population. And some seeming imbalances in speciation too, like very few flying things, as well as some mutations and variations that were not designed so much as allowed to proceed. 


Mantemar contains several large land masses. Our story takes place (for now) only on the northern land mass referred to as Lurabar.  For most of the characters in our story, little is known of the lands of Lurabar outside of the Saskantinon, and virtually nothing of the lands beyond the sea.

There are two islands of considerable size — they could even be considered small continents —  to the east of Lurabar. The first is Pentacross and the second Greenstrand. North of Pentacross is the cold and icy island of Bir, the northernmost land. To the west of Lurabar are a group of four islands, plus three more small islands much further west, actually closer to Mudhook than to the other islands in this group.  While three of these islands are quite sizable, none are anywhere near as large as those to the East. They are called, collectively, The Firelands.  

The largest land mass in the world lies to the south of Lurabar; it is called Bricot.  South of Bricot lies the southernmost land of Mantemar, a nearly uninhabitable land frozen in ice.  Some legends say that the frozen land of Rikondo passes beyond the Enclosure, that is, beyond the Edge of the World, but none of whom we know have ever traveled there and back again.  A sizable island to the west of Bricot is called Mudhook. Two smaller islands to the east of Bricot’s thinning peninsular eastern extension, well to south of Pentacross and Greenstrand, are called, collectively, Asterlorn. 


Between Lurabar’s Krbshanana Peninsula, Bricot northeastern shore, and to the southwest of Pentacross lie a collection of islands, some a bit larger, some quite small, scattered over hundreds of klicks of ocean. These, along with several of the extruberances along the southern cost of the Forg (southeastern Luramar), and an island just off the eastern coast of Luramar, bordering the Realms of the Shanowa, are referred to collectively as The Remari, which can be loosely translated as “holes in the ocean”.  Some parts of our story take place there.

            <Text>Barfalot
60+ • Always on the move

Role in Story
More or less a narrator, he is a bard, a story-teller and a song-collector by trade. He travels easily through many different kinds of communities. He knows more about the big picture than most characters.  His typical performances are more reminiscent of, say, Hank Williams or Jimmie Rodgers, than Bob Wills.  
Goal
By exploring his back-story, we learn about the geography, languages, communities, stories of the Lands.  By following his travels, we should eventually uncover the great secret of the Event.  He is something like the private investigator in a noir mystery.
Physical Description
20% canine, noticeable mainly in his hands, only slightly in his face. Hairy. Long but not floppy ears.  A slightly protruded mouth. Sharp teeth (canines). Acute sense of smell.  Dresses in an unassuming “country” style, mostly in black and grays.  
Personality
Avuncular without being obsequious. Thoughtful and philosophical. 
Occupation
Bard. Also a member of Mages guild, which he typically denies. 
Habits/Mannerisms
Likes to drink s’lah but not to excess. Will smoke a pipe if offered, but not habitually. Is a vegetarian for ethical reasons, though often has carnivorous instincts. 
Background
His parents were refugees from the Hot Delta. He had some siblings but doesn’t remember them well. They lived in the wild and on the fringes of villages. He learned to sing and to read at a young age, thanks to a some wandering bards. His father was killed by wild animals.  (He may have been selected for covert training by Agents.) Ran away many times. Often in trouble with the Watches as a youngster. Enslaved for a couple of years, then spent a couple of years at the Beet Farm, where he was often visited by his Mama, who encouraged him to become a Bard and not fall in with the basimi gangs. Upon his release, and after his mother passed away, he started wandering and gathering songs.  He spent several years with a ‘mages’ collective (again, possibly influenced by Agent) where he became aware of the true nature of the Event and the Enclosure, and studied philosophy in some depth. 
Internal Conflicts
Assimilation issues. Doesn’t wholly fit in with either puros or impuros communities. Has sympathy for both.
Philosophical issues. As someone who is aware of the nature of the Event and the Enclosure, he is often pondering contingency/necessity. How free can they be? What is the real nature of language? And so on.
Loneliness. Lack of / loss of family.  Often wonders if he could connect with his lost siblings.
Deep knowledge of speciation makes him a careful observer of puros/impuros psychology and behavior patterns.
Vegetarian with carnivorous instincts.
Is both nerdy and street smart.
External Conflicts
He is considered to be a potential criminal element by the Helioptic authorities, who keep an eye on him.
Animal separatists don’t trust his many connections with puros and Heliop communities.
His knowledge of astronomy puts him at odds both Heliops and some of the more ‘woo’ star-gazer types.
His knowledge of ‘ancient secrets’ makes him both loved and feared by various cults.
His knowledge of the Enclosure makes him a person of interest among the Agents.

            <Text>Barfalot uses connections with Inn Keepers, Wind Lords, Kahrn/herbalists, Henqu, Iohane and others to create a “popular journal”, something never seen before.

The “Saskan Times” is an illustrated folio (8 pages), written mostly in Eeber with some articles in Oober. It is published weekly and sold in the towns mostly via Free Innkeepers. At 10 bits a copy, only the wealthy can afford it, but it is passed from hand to hand, each copy read many times and often read aloud as well. 

It contains news of goings-on in the towns and in the country side, as well as lyrics to new songs or modifications to classics bardsongs. 

Published in New Weyr with stories, news, drawings collected by Barfalot’s far-flung network and brought to the west by various means. Some gossip and innuendo is included, along with heroic depictions of characters in our story.  It provides a kind of story-within-the-story mechanism, and is a story-line in itself. “The Passion of Henqu” is a recurring series and it becomes widely popular, which eventually contributes to the attempt to subject Henqu to the extremes of a Gleaming.

The journal also popularizes Birakay and promotes him in the role of Ark Pilot.

            <Text>Birakay
21 seasons • Qurol

Role in Story
Entertainment. A bit of a court jester. An example of being pulled from the Sunny Side to the Dark Side.

Goal
Bring deeper perspective and understanding into role of Bards and song/music generally into the story line.
Provide some lighter balance to many of the “heavy” themes in story. 

Physical Description
Fashionable, “hot”, with lots of sex appeal. Often seen with a broad grin or smile. Though maintaining Helioptic gender-neutral norms, since Birakay is neither partnered nor holder of any official position of authority, his appearance and presentation is more geared towards distinctly “bad boy” male, but usually not in an extremely macho fashion. Think something like River Phoenix or James Dean around age 20.  

Personality
The most popular Bard in the Saskan Lands, a “rock star” of sorts. Sings beautifully, knows all the songs and performs well in ensembles as well as solo.   

Occupation
Since the Bards Guild is officially sanctioned in the Heliop provinces, his membership in it is an open secret, publicly denied. His official job is with the River Watch at the docks of Qurol, though his responsibilities there are murky and seem to consist mainly of greeting visitors along the river and along the Ring. Qurol is far and away the most free-wheeling of the Helioptic towns and the only one where the [mayor] presents as female. Birakay’s most raucous performances are at the great brothel house of Qurol.  

Habits/Mannerisms
While his public persona is carefully crafted and he enjoys celebrity status, Birakay is a serious musician and a strong defender of and advocate for bards, players, actors and poets. He spends a good bit of time working on writing and composing fresh material - some of it purely for popular consumption, other works remain hidden or performed only outside of the Helioptic provinces. In public he is outgoing, a bit brash, and flirts with everyone.  In person he is kind and considerate, abhors violence and prejudice, and is gay as Christmas.

Background
Raised in a Qurol brooder house. The natural child of a local innkeeper and an itinerant Ring Rider. Birakay exhibited musical talent early in life. He was lucky enough to have been noticed at an early age by the “mage” Barfalot, who used his back-channel influences to see to it that the boy was trained by local bards who perform sub-rosa in the back streets of Qurol. He was drafted into the River Watch, as are many Qurol youths. Once stationed in the barracks of the River Guards, he soon began to express male gender and explore homosexuality in an open way. The latter is not considered “bad” or even unusual in the Saskan Lands — whereas the open expression of male gender at such a young age was definitely considered “rebellious”. This might have caused some trouble for him if he lived in a different town and hadn’t soon become a local celebrity due to his extraordinary musical performances.

Internal Conflicts
Has not overcome his Helioptic ideological training and thus worries that his male expression and his embrace of new songs will help contribute to the Re-emergence (of the Catastrophe).  Is drawn towards various “resistance” forces amongst the Barbosal and the Kahila, the star-gazers and so on, particularly when they offer alternative views on gender expression and new music. 

External Conflicts
His ever-deepening involvements with the Bards and other “mooney” undertakings has drawn the attention of the Night Watch. He is warned by both friends and foes to watch his back.  An opportunity to take on the role of the mythical Irate Monarch and to become the “Pilot of the Chrome Ark” forces him to finally choose sides.

            <Text>Gallex
20 seasons • Isle of Wye

Role in Story

Represents a non-Kahila, non-Helioptic unshaped, unmodified human.   
Goal
Among other things, show the distinction between Stargazer and Astrologers.  

Physical Description
Part of the Stargazing [Pentrak] ‘Clan’, Gallex is lithe, quick, dark and strong.   Does not present a specific gender.

Personality


Occupation
Apprentice to a commander of the ‘Wyenaught’ militia, a mercenary group located in the interior of the Isle of Wye, driven ideologically by Stargazing, with ties to various militant and basimi circles in Beaverton, Wye, Morilly and Barqton.  Some naval knowledge, but mostly on the rivers not the sea. 

Trained in the use of knives and bows.  Is being groomed to help organize refugee defense units and possibly foment dissent within Helioptic Guard units. 

Habits/Mannerisms


Background
Parents were defectors from the Town of Stanbuk in the Tobaloon who’d rejected Helioptic social norms and started to live together as a heteronormative couple. They raised their first child themselves, in secret, but were found out when the mother was pregnant was the 2nd child — Gallex.  Although small families are not strictly contrary to law, they had also begun to secretly study Astrological materials.  When the eldest child was caught by the Day Watch singing a popular Kahila ditty having to do with the motion of the 3rd Wanderer, the entire family was sanctioned and scheduled. Fearing the worse at the next Gleaming, they escaped first to Brokilly then made their way down the Barbo to Beaverton.  There they were kidnapped and interrogated by the Pentrak Clan, who eventually took them away to the Isle of Wye.

The children quickly adapted and thrive in the free-flowing Pentrak lifestyle.  The parents work as field hands supporting the Pentraks.

Internal Conflicts
The Stargazer belief system is in sharp contradiction to Sun worship. It is effectively the mirror-opposite.  While the parents of Gallex had developed a kind of liberal opposition to the Sun-centered beliefs and traditions, the Stargazers have trained Gallex to distrust the parents, whom they still suspect as potential deep infiltrators or spies and keep fairly isolated from their offspring — just as the Heliops sought to do. 

External Conflicts
The family have been found “star-crossed in extremis” by the Night Watch, which is to say, more or less declared to be “witches”.   The fact that the kids are also now members of a Kahila-friendly armed group puts them near the top of the list of “enemies of the state” as far as Jook is concerned.

            <Title>Qurol in Borda Woods</Title>
            <Text>Qurol
In the Borda Woods, on the Ring, on the River [Bloo]

Role in Story
One of the most “open” and beautiful and popular of the Helioptic Towns. 

Related Characters
The High Priest of the Sunny Center has hands quite busy dealing with all the travellers, commercial trade, immigrants from the west.  Although very much officially a Helioptic-dominated town, dedication to Law, to the Watch, is less about policing belief and more about bringing in the goods. For this reason, the Days of Gleaming in Qurol are much more ceremonial and much less physical than in some other towns.

Season
Quite a beautiful place, with its views of the river and the ring, hills to the north and west, the forest of the Borda Woods to the south and the rich farmlands and villages along the River to the east. 

Unique Features
Has a rich collection of bard songs, due in part to its proximity to Eelan.

Description
Has a large contingent of Helioptic Guards and Volunteers. Though they remain fairly quiet and out of sight, the town is in fact very well fortified. In Helioptic terms, it is considered the “Lion’s Gate” protecting the north-western corner of the Heliopticon. 
Lots of trading, bartering, negotiating goes on here as various Heliop factions and guilds, a number of independents and Rider-affiliated groups, as well as [Finders] and others seek to buy, steal, borrow, exchange, expropriate, learn from/inform on each other.  
Sights
Five working streetlights are maintained for the amusement of traditionalist visitors.  There are several small [“Jossist”] temples in Qurol.
The [“Finders Guild”] has a significant presence in the Town, with many sorts of oddball goods and services on offer. 
 A cash/ATM machine — another shrine-like destination — is actually a spy station/drop site for a secret, underground enclave of Createds from the Krunk. Many Jaxen emerge from and are re-cycled through Qurol.  It is easy to recruit servants and “redshirts” in Qurol as a result.  During the epic events of the book, there will be “trouble in river city” because of this — masked as something like a “servants uprising”.  
Sounds
Due to its role as a transit and exchange hub, quite a few languages and dialects are heard here.
As one of the older towns — it predates the expansion of authority by the Heliocastron known as the Reckoning — Qurol has a rich bard song tradition that encompasses much more than tunes and lyrics favored by the Sun-worshipers. Performance is common in inns and public spaces.

            <Title>Scene 1</Title>
            <Synopsis>Getting in the door</Synopsis>
            <Text>As the old gray cur slipped into the Two Moons, he dropped a small handful of  tubits into the backhanded open palm of the off-duty basherbazooki watching the door. 
The basherbazooki mumbled a greeting to the old bard: “Barfalot. Been a while, dog. Where ya been to?”
“Grrrrr... Yer mother’s a bullock. Mind yer own business,” the dog-sint story teller replied in a barely audible growl. 
The bouncer smirked. In reply, he stomped a foot hard enough to give the old man a start.  With their sizable musculature, one might be forgiven for thinking that a basher’s formidable leg-ends, shod in well-fortified Hadaki combat boots did indeed, as Barfalot had implied, end in hooves rather than the kind of feet more appropriate to a homo sapiens.  Few folks in the Land Between Two Rivers speculate on such matters with such a person, much less jest about it to their face.
But Barfalot was well-known as a joker. 

An old dog can thrive in place like Rika by knowing how to push things up to the limit of decency, perhaps a tad bit more, but not any farther. Just enough to get a rise.  Maybe glean some info.  Not enough to get a stomping. 
Once inside the Two Moons, Barfalot found the Jax he was looking for.  Turning on his story-teller charm, he took a seat at a long table and shared a free wisdom lesson with the young Lookie.  
The Jax listened carefully, trying to make out words from Barfalot’s thick Growlish dialect:   “Listen, Jax, did you hear me teasing that basherbazooki at the door about his gigantic feet?  See ‘em?  Know why he keeps ‘em hidden in those boots?  Because a sint who appears to be fully human gets better grub and earns higher rank than one with an obvious mix of, say, sapiens and bos in their family tree. Know what I mean.  That’s why your basherbazooki friend  hides his hooves. See?  Now listen. I let him know I know because that gives me some leverage. In case I need a friend. Y’see what I mean?  That’s how you earn leverage. That’s what I’m teaching you today.  For free.” 
Barfalot was aware that, despite their limited mental and verbal capacity, every free Jax wants to improve their understanding of the Enclosure.  A Jax is forever trying to separate out in their little piece of the collective Jax mind. Teasing out bits real knowledge gleaned by lived experience from implanted memories acquired at the Farm can furrow the brow of a Jax in an aha way.  Seeing that expression was one of the small pleasures, Barfalot knew, that can make a difficult day more bearable. 
The Lookie wrinkled its forehead in concentration. 
A smile swept over the old man’s face as quickly as a beaver-crew shoots the rapids of the Bloo on their way back to Beaverton.
Then they stared blankly into the old feller’s eyes with a look that said, “I understood about a tenth of that.”  What they actually said, entirely predictably, was, “Well met! Say, friend, my name’s Jax. Are you planning an adventure?  Do you need some assistance? I understand that you may need a friend, yes? Am I right?”
Barfalot’s countenance resumed its weary road-worn look.

In a mean space like the Bishopric of Saskantinon, in its cruel towns like Rika, it’s not unusual for folks to take advantage of  Lookalikes.  Telling them lies in order to gain their confidence, to get them to do your bidding.  A typical scam was to take one on as an expendable crew member to do the dangerous work.
He tipped the clone an abeyt and instructed them to let the proprietor know he’d arrived. 

As he waited, Barfalot let his thoughts wander. He bore a name that’s just a joke to puros, the pure homo sapiens who dominated politics within the Ring.  It had been assigned to him by a none-too-kind puros who’d discovered his canine features and then enslaved him as an impuros, as a pet and an unpaid worker.  That was many, many moons ago.  Long before he’d become a song-catcher, and a bard and had - for better  or worse - gained the reputation of a mage.
He wondered if he’d had a name prior to that. He couldn’t remember. He suspected that the whole ‘naming’ thing was a human habit anyway, and considered, as he studied the intricately-wrought beams of the bar-rooms ceiling, that when he visited the extensive warrens of the ALF strongholds well to the south of the Ring, collecting the new songs made popular by their resistance movement, nearly every rabbit-sint he met introduced each other only as ‘my brother’, ‘the noble sister’, ‘leading comrade’, ‘platoon leader’ and so on.
With his long experience of pain and suffering, Barfalot had a lot of pity to spare for all the “moon-spawned, star-born creatures of the night”, as the Heliop slander put it.  He didn’t believe a single one of the Sun worshipers’ ill-informed explanations for the many variations of life that had emerged since the Event.   
He knew enough about the Land Between Two Rivers, and many of the Lands Beyond, to have some pity for the puros too, who, despite their illusions of superiority, also suffered in this life and, as far as Barfalot could make out, met their end as surely and often as swiftly as the other sints.  
Well. Except maybe those tied into the genetic line of terrapins and sea turtles. He suspected them of having inherited something like a gem of immortality from their sea-born ancestors.

It was time to have a bit of fun.
Barfalot threw back his head, cleared his throat, and recited, in a sing-song way, while tapping out a beat on the table, a bit of doggerel in oBark, the forbidden “language of the animals”, from the age-old Bard Songs of the Givakola, known and loved by all sints regardless of their station and community.
Practicing the kind of showmanship that earns a bard a pile of tubeyts now and again, he included in his recital some canine sounds that would be interpreted by most iBar-speakers as dog-sint, or possibly even the sounds of a natural non-sentient dog, expressing some level of disappointment:  that mournful country-yodel that only dogs can do with full justice to the form.  
It was the kind of performance that would get a sint reprimanded by the Day Watch, or hauled away by the Night Watch, in a Heliops-controlled town. It was the kind of performance that the patrons of the Two Moons reveled in.
From the murky depths of the bar room came a chorus of growlish chuckles. Those denizens of the Two Moons who had a bit of oBark quickly picked up on his take on the old favorite, joining in on the well-known refrain with a harmony of various animal-toned inflections, “Oh if I had an abeyt / for every stupid thing a Jax said / I’d be richer than a Watcher / of the Fire Lands!”. 

The Jax had returned during the recital. They told Barfalot, as the chorus wound down, that the proprietor would be with him shortly.
He reached into his small money-pouch, extending small retractable fingers from gloved hands to manipulate the coins once the paw-like protrusion of his palm was out of sight from prying eyes. To a casual observer watching across a smoky bar room, he was just an ordinary old fellow scratching his belly.
At 60-plus solar turns, ancient by most typical measures. Barfalot’s secret to longevity included concealing his 20-some-percent canine mix not only from the Night Watch, but from anybody else who didn’t have a need to know the extent of his impuros.   
In perfectly fluent iBar with only a hint of an iBark accent, the multilingual and multi-talented bard said, “Jax, my friend.  I would very much like a bowl of s’lah while we wait for Master Kirill. Can you help me with that?  Here’s a kite for the barkipper and a kite for your troubles,” he said, deftly passing the small coins along to his front paw and handing them over.  

The Jax beamed with delight as they sauntered over to the bar, pleased as punch to be helping with a mission, and returning in a jiffy to hand his new friend a bowl of the ubiquitous drink.</Text>

27 • Borded

Role in Story
Provide a harmony tying together events around the Ring, insight into the life of a Ring Rider.

Goal
To hear the silence of a falling star lighting up a purple sky. To show the way. To tie together the old traditions and the new path.
Physical Description
Lanky but physically strong. Female/hetero, un-partnered but likely in love with Henqu. Like all Ring Riders, outward appearance/presentation is gender neutral. Usually seen only well-armored and armed. 

Personality
Outspoken in a fairly likable way. Good at intervening in dicey situations before they get out of hand, using her words to calm down conflicts.  But strong as an ox and twice as deadly when needed.

Occupation
Ring Rider.

Habits/Mannerisms
Always correct, as befits a Ring Rider, but willing to crack a joke to ease tensions, or to make a slightly racy or caustic remark in order to get folks’ attention. 

Background
From a hardscrabble farming village in the Norgyte. Most of her clan are battle-hardened, having defended their farms many times from Entropic raiders coming down from the Wesshewen plains.  Recruited into the Day Watch in Mizry after serving a time with the Volunteers, Iohane chose to abandon the Heliop barracks, voluntarily went to Borded when she was 21 to offer her sword to the Riders Council.  This happened after a chance encounter with a Ring Rider named Henqu, who impressed her immensely, not least of all with his song.  

Internal Conflicts
Prone to seeing the best in all the traditions and over-looking the worst, Iohane is a natural advocate for unity between humans and non-humans, between Heliops, Kahila, Barbosal, Arnazen and so on. She has a vast vision of post-Catastrophical unity that even encompasses the Entropic tribes and the faraway lands of Shanowa and Ayshewen. The threats posed by the monsters of the Lewshan Mountains, the unknown mysteries of the Forg and the Komexenon, and the dire possibilities of Re-emergence posed by the Created, or whatever they are, in the Krunkinotto, give her pause. She worries that only an apocalyptic conflict with such forces can remove the threat they pose, but she believes there is a “higher power” that will come the aid of the sentients.

External Conflicts
All the usual problems of being a cop on the Ring, plus some continuing meanness and vulgarity from former comrades in Mizry and the surrounding parts of the Ring where efforts were made to tarnish her reputation after she joined the Riders.

North-western border province

Role in Story

The site of some great battles.

Sacrifice. Duty.
Related Characters

The Mabalbesq Trail which heads off in a northwesterly direction towards the Weshewn border, leading up into the Forbidden Hills, on the way to the shadowy mountainous enclaves of the Krunkimoto

The Krunk lowlands are  referred to in the long sad hypnotic ballads collected in the cycle known as the Riders' Bardsongs of the Mabalbesq as the Valleys of Fear.   
Season
Known as a fairly cold and windy place. 

Unique Features
The prison town of Beet is located in its northeastern-most corner.  
A large fortified encampment (“Camp Borda”, “Bo’Mabal”) is located in the province, guarding the Saskan Lands from Krunki incursions.  


Description
The location of many historic battles. Travellers in the region will see numerous commemorations  to the fallen. 
Prison-gang work units are common in the northern part of the province.  

Sights
Rolling, grassy plains. Both farming and grazing. 
Fences and hedges are deeply frowned-upon in this region. There is a popular/traditional sentiment of reverence for the big sky. Although the province is generally and correctly considered to be a Rider stronghold, there are many Helioptic influences as well. This has created a kind of kinder-gentler version of sun-worship that focuses on the sky as a whole, puts much less emphasis on fear of the night, stars. 
Sounds
Along with the more martial Riders’ Bardsongs, the region is also home to a rich tradition of song and music relating to “the Beet Farm”, including many kinds of bluesy laments as well as songs celebrating populist criminals and rebels, songs telling sad tales of endings and persecutions, and some with cryptic instructions on how to help escapees, how to avoid incarceration, and how to connect with rebel networks inside “the Big House”.

Is literally burning up inside. Suffers a good bit of physical pain.  The fire mutation releases the pain.  Not using it increases internal pressure.  Probably needs medical attention or a more useful way to exercise special abilities, but doesn’t know where/how to get it.
The work with the [Basimi outfit] has not yet involved direct acts of assassination, but Mur’ray knows that this is coming and is not entirely down with that.  The “Big Tree” Helioptic Volunteers of Salotrize and Eeber are the main line of defense against the monstrous forces from the Lewshan Mountains who are coming closer and closer to the border every day.
External Conflicts
Is starting to feel used by the [Basimi]. This particular outfit has a cult of martyrdom playing out in their warfare with the Catastrophonics, but it seems to involve mainly the martyrdom of foreign recruits and young people.  The more events, as they call their raids, are carried out, the more risk Mur’ray faces both in terms of being hurt or killed, and in terms of drawing the attention of the Watchers, the Special Division and so on.

            <Text>Lohrn the Carpenter
24 • Rikila

Role in Story
Give a perspective on the foreign lands to the west. Help depict internal workings of an important Guild organization.

Goal
Provide a “commoner’s” view of the events in Rikila. Someone who just wants to get thru the day without too much trouble, isn’t interested in joining any factions. 

Physical Description
Small, usually a bit messy due to constant hard working and tendency towards intoxicants. Has a “foreign” (western) accent. Does not have a partner and is not in a position of authority, so sexual/gender identity remains neutral/unclear in public settings.  

Personality
Smart. Observant. Quiet.  Tends to focus on practical matters, has an engineer’s eye for things.

Occupation
Is apprenticed to a member of the Carpenter’s Council (c.f. Otto Templaron Trucent).

Habits/Mannerisms
Quiet, somewhat fearful. Occasional bouts of drunkeness/intoxication. May be an addict. Has been traumatized and is reluctant to trust anyone. Years in care of Riders/Carpenters brought about better socialization, but has not addressed deeper scars.  

Background
An orphaned refugee from the far west, beyond the Krunkinotto. Home village was ravaged by Entropics (wild bands of marauders, common in Weshewen, but also seen further west), who enslaved Lohrn as a child. Escaped during a conflict with a Cloned outpost in the mountains, headed south eventually taking a raft downriver into Bordaloon. Learned to speak Eeber in Borded and was put into care of independent Brooders tied to the Carpenters Guild. After hearing the background story during a visit to the brood house, Trucent requested Lohrn as apprentice and then had hir relocated to Rikila.  

Internal Conflicts
Many psychological scars. Abuse by Entropics left alot of unresolved anger, which Lohrn keeps bottled up.

External Conflicts
Somewhat sympathetic towards the Cloned due to their role in freeing Lohrn from enslavement, an attitude that is typically very unpopular in the Saskan Lands and gets Lohrn into trouble from time to time. Deepening reliance on intoxicants is drawing Lohrn into unsavory (literally) underworld connections

            <Title>Economics</Title>
            <Text>The region is relatively wealthy and prosperous, as compared to bordering regions like Weshewen, Lewshanana, Krbshanana, the Forg and even Aranzen.  

A key reason why so many non-humans stay in Saskantinon despite its somewhat confusing and even harsh political environment is the fact that agriculture does well in the region.  Nearly all of the towns and villages in the area maintain farming operations at one level or another of technological advancement.  Many farmers are free-holders. In the south, the Herbalist Federation acts as a kind of farmers cooperative. Many others are more-or-less vassals who work to support the nearest town and its institutions.  While the technological level is fairly rudimentary in many areas, the land is fertile enough to support a variety of techniques. 

Land “ownership” is seldom private and individual. Where it is not in the trust of a local organization or guild, it is often held by a collective of some kind and treated as something like a common resource.  

The region also supports a lot of grazing and hunting, especially in the north.  

It supports both a pastoral and nomadic economies, though nomadic/travelling bands are less common than settled ones. 

Domesticated livestock is common in the human regions of the north, though it is also the source of ongoing disputes and even sometimes violent conflicts between animal-liberationists and human-supremacists.  

A variety of wild beasts who are not sentient – in the sense that they do not use tools, use a language intelligible to other species, create urban or village centers, or develop an oral or written literature – roam the plains and mountains, especially in the northern, eastern and southern regions outside of the Ring. 

Hunting expeditions, almost always – but not exclusively – organized by humans or human-appearing guilders, constantly work these areas.  They gather and hunt in the western mountains and rivers too, although there tends to be less available prey in those areas. 

Mining operations are located in the western mountains, as well as near the marshy Krbshsea shoreline of the southeastern Oobar-speaking region.  Fshing and sea-going trades also work this area, although, as with hunting, this type of work can be fraught with difficulties and conflict due to the large number of fully-sentient animals inhabiting the Delta of Lewshanana as well as the Krbshsea itself.  

In the larger context, sea-going trade in the near-sea is dominated by humans from Saskan Lands and animals or mixed sentients from both Lewshanana and Krbshanana, with some from the Forg, the Komexecon and Aranzen. 

Except for Lewshanana, the regions which border the Heliopticon to the east and to the south have enormous coastlines.  In the case of Krbshanana, it also has a large sentient marine population living within the Krbshsea itself. </Text>

            <Text>Otto Templaron Trucent
32 • Borded

Role in Story
A key link to the Agency and a “glue” that helps to tie together story lines for various characters. 

Goal
Introduce as a mystery and keep it that way, revealing bits and pieces about Otto as things unfold. 

Physical Description
Strongly male-identified, wears a uniform of sorts, maybe a cape, badges, a special hat. Has a “regal” aspect.
Although Otto speaks perfect proper Eeber, is an avowed Catastrophian loyal to the Helioptic traditions and employed in the Rider complex of businesses, he has a slightly “other-worldly” character that even he cannot explain.

Personality
Self-important in a beguiling way. Comfortable dealing with “important” and “powerful” people, but capable of communicating in a sympathetic manner with folks from any station. Somewhat stand-offish with mixed folks.

Occupation
Member of the High Council of the Free Carpenters Guild, which makes him a participant in some circles of Riders governance. 

Habits/Mannerisms
An enigma in many ways. Moves as easily through meetings with Helioptic Scribes in Beshoqua as he does strolling through the mountains with the leading nobles of New Weyr or sitting through negotiations with a chatty bunch of legal-eagles in Beaverton. A popular and successful guilder heading up an important group of craftspeople, Otto is a sought-after go-between.  

Background
His family life is a mystery to many. He has no parents or siblings in the region. There is no registration of a partnering, though he has been spending a lot of time in New Weyr visiting his friend [a wind lord]. He flirts freely with many whom he encounters and is known to have fathered several broodkins. 

His own recollection is of growing up on a farm in Rontana as part of a natural family with mild Helioptic beliefs, of his gentle parents passing away of natural causes, of various siblings and farm hands who drifted away into other trades, of learning to ride a sloebeest at a young age and entertaining fantasies of becoming a Ring Rider, of the farm passing to new tenants once Otto moved to Borded to join the carpenters. 

The truth is that he is the child of leading members of the 7th Observation Squad of the Intra-Galactic Rehabilitation Agency, star-born, moon-raised,(temporarily) memory-wiped, and injected into human society at age 12 (when he “chose to join the carpenters”) as part of an Agency program to get a closer grip on the problems they are dealing with.  He is scheduled to be recalled and debriefed soon. 

Internal Conflicts
Strange recurring dreams that are difficult to make sense of, that sometimes seem to be about his youth, sometimes seem to be very specific directives.

External Conflicts
His New Weyr love affair is about to blow up when he finds out his beloved has been promised to another.

            <Title>Waleran's Rest</Title>
            <Text>Waleran re-read Birakay’s message over and over and made a dozen copies for sending out once the next bunch of runners were available.  Stay still and wait for them to return.  That’s what Lukando’d said to do. Just stay out of sight and wait for them.  

A close look showed rations left in the survival kit added up to two weeks worth of beast jerky and road gruel. Whether Birakay’s message was true or was just some fantastic malarkey that’d been dreamed up before ascending — an image Waleran was fond of conjuring up, doting especially on Birakay’s infectious grin as it faded away into the mists, carried off on the bridge of the Chrome Ark  — yeah, fair play to give such a good-looker a full run, Waleran mused, and so, as the light began to fade, dutifully finishing scribbling the last of the copies while chewing studiously on previous bite of Giváklan beast jerky, it was a small comfort to recall that scene while carrying out this important task, even if the night was falling and one was all alone in a strange woods, said to be full of dangering-folk, in a foreign land.

Waleran’d been hearing some strange tones coming from the hidden Kahila watchtowers of the Barbakal forest. It didn’t sound like messages in Aranzen Doribah, a singing language Waleran knew well. And it sounded nothing like the garbled, growlish Oobarq the Alfer’s usually put out either.  There’d been snippets of songs too, sporadically lilting through the woods.  Hard to make  out, but it sounded something like the super-ritualistic Old Eeber one might hear in the River Temple of Barbol during liturgical celebrations of the Earth-Soul, but oddly distant and somehow resonant of Barakay’s optimistic message too, with a certain melancholic uplift to it.

More thinking about it made the situation seem scarier. But that didn’t stop Waleran from obsessing about it even more. 

This is all ludicrous, Waleran thought, after this, I simply need to keep moving, get through the Kahilabarbakal, pass through the Juujal too and then Róntana without getting snatched, deliver a copy of Briakay’s lyrics directly to the contact in Rútonik, get across the river into Eeber, righty-oh, then head on up into the battle zone north of Big Tree to hook up with Mur’ray and the Big Tree Heliop Volunteers. Just need to get past the Most Loyal Volunteers and their pharking mercenary thought-cops. Pharking Night Watch meat-eaters. OK. Easy-peasy.  Yeah sure. And if, when, no if, no if I should get snatched then no doubt they’ll find Birakay’s little poem here is not exactly “brightly rendered sapient-realist literature”.  So. I just can’t get caught. That’s all. Sheesh.  Moons runes!  Wish I could’ve just handed this off to the Independent Scribes of Blue Bar.  Barfo said they’re the best and he knows things.  Could get it translated into Oober and Eeber and the ‘barqs, maybe a few of the little bers too, then once the Bards start to sing it out, who knows?   It’ll spread along the rivers, all around the Ring, maybe to other lands.  Perhaps it’ll mean something to somebody somewhere in some kind of organic fashion. Stars ’n jars! Yeah! That’s the song.  Maybe I could earn a few bits too. I’ve heard they pay well for good material in Blue Bar.  Argh.  Nah. Can it, you old dodger. Anyway, can’t waste time heading to the coast. Lukando’d turn into a blue cow.  I’d probably never make it across into Blurbaroon anyway. Damn Watcher’s hired mind-pharkers’d pick me off the moment I left the forest. 

Waleran considered as to how there’d been plenty of wanderers and refugees and Fool-Knows-Who’s scurrying all around in the Barbakal woods.  Yeah. Don’t worry.  No fear.  Those Alfer message-runners will be back before too long. Good runners too, those freaky-deaky rabbits.  Feeling the heft of its holster, Walleran’s next comforting thought about the two boxes of good metal Borded slings nestled at the bottom of the survival kit.  It was my lucky night when I got that rapid peg-slinger from that Norgyte bang-runner at the Candlemakers Hall in Givákala.  I’ll need it probably.  Oh Jexa! Oh Mother of Mercy.  Hopefully not. Probably will though… I should do some practice shooting.

Birakay’s song spoke, in the elliptical and poetic prose of well-crafted High Eeber, but in obvious way to anyone paying attention, of the Riders, and the Heliops on the one hand, and of the Kahila, the Beavers, the Barbaros and various travellers and refugees putting aside their differences in order to take on the hideous onslaught pouring down from Lewshan mountains.  It spoke of a Great Forum where lovers of knowledge from each of the ancient traditions could meet to resolve their differences, or at least find some common ground.  Waleran had been through enough brutal conflicts and was enough of a star-math to know, or to predict, that fine words can be the prelude to serious fireworks, that despite the deployment of fine poetry, people can be real shits, that the finest words can lead to the greatest betrayals, that a raven-sent will befriend and then tease a wolf-sent just in order to steal its kill…

The Sun had fallen during these musings. Waleran looked up at the night sky to read the position of the far wanderers.  A falling star on the eastern horizon caught the astrologer’s attention as well.  A quick calculation and a quietly-breathed chant to the Goddess of the Seventh Wanderer, and then a careful listen for it mental echo, led to the conclusion that the Goddess was preparing a love potion for all the demented hucksters of the Saskan Lands, with their outmoded belief systems and lousy bio-programming, but that their disease was malignant and the potion may take a long while to effect a cure. 

Eyes gently fluttering to a close, Waleran rested in the certainty that cool, defiant, courageous ones, like oneself, like Birakay and Lukando, and other wise, brave, courageous, talented performers and players and teachers like them, would soon be able to leverage the present disorder to make their way to safe harbors and to good havens, where they would be able to enjoy one another’ company until the love-potion began to work.  Drifting off, Waleran imagined the watchtowers of all the great towns announcing a special song sung by the Handsome and Beautiful and Talented Pilot of the Chrome Ark, Birakay, to all those everywhere who have been diligently carrying their hidden torchlights in the caves of resistance, and then a great Hum arising across the Lands of Saskantinon, as the true history of the enclosure is revealed.  All one has to do is be cool and courageous. A little patience goes a long way when you’re following the purple light of the deep knowledge, dontcha know.  And all the bards around the Ring began to sing a new tune declaring the autonomy of each and every one who sings it and, as Waleran slept, the legendary dance of declaration of the joyful founding of the Town of Freedom unfolded in a slow-moving but deeply rhythmic Terrapin bop, soothing one and all like a souvenir of happier times that settles all the tremors of a troubled mind.

            <Title>Borded in Salofess and Mabalbesq</Title>
            <Text>Borded
On the Ring, on the main Tributary of the Northern River

Borded is the largest and in many ways the most important town in Saskantinon.  It is the most powerful enclave within the region that is not under the control of the Heliocastron and it the central town for four northeastern districts, including the Riders Realms of Mabalbesq, Bordaloon and Salofess. With its strong walls, well-cared-for streets and buildings, many of which are made of enormous stones, its beautiful gardens and the large well-tended free-holder fields which surround it, the town of Borded, the Riders Town, is a wonder and a delight to behold.  

The Riders Council provides for the preservation of order in Borded.  As the home base of a militarized guild which specializes in import-export trade and arms manufacturing, Borded is both well-provisioned and well-fortified.  


Sitting astride the Ring to the northeast, Borded is Saskantinon's great jewel along the River Bloobar, which flows by just to the south of the town.   In times of trouble, sentient folk from all the surrounding regions flock to the protection of its massive walls. Its two towering gates on the Ring Road make it impossible to proceed along the Ring without passing through Borded. A smallernorthern gate opens to the Mabal Trail, leading north to the border town of Beet.  

Dominating the Ring Road in this way forces many foreign travelers to go through Borded on their way to the Helioptic capital or to pretty much anywhere else in Saskantinon.


One might usefully think of the sub-areas , usually referred to as provinces [we’ll find more words…] of Saskantinon as something like counties or departments or districts.  None of them have official standing as far as the Helioptic Union is concerned, but these sub-regional designations are very commonly-used cultural, historical, demographic and geographical terms and many residents of the Saskan Lands refer to these sub-regions in a fundamental way.  The districts are sometimes grouped as either Inside or Outside, depending on whether they sit inside or outside of the Great Ring Road.  

Borded is the focal point for four of the Eibar-speaking northeastern regions, encompassing two “Outside” provinces – Mabalbesq and Bordaloon – and one “Inside”: Salofess.  The Riders Council also has a strong but considerable less direct influence on the region of Eelan, the south of Bordaloon.


In the steeply ascending mountains to the west of Borded, following the River Bloobar up into the “Forbidden Hills” of the Krunkinotto, is the heavily guarded Outer Province of Mabalbesq, patrolled almost exclusively by the Riders. The Mabalbesq is the only human-inhabited region of Saskantinon that is, for all intents and purposes (though not officially) off-limits to Heliocastronic agencies.  It is the Rider hinterland.   


A High Priest of the Heliocastronic Office is assigned to the Town of Borded.  He resides in a fine temple and receives respectful treatment as the leader of a popular religion and chair of an important guild alliance. But the Helioptic Union does not control Borded.  Here the Sun's Watchers are not even permitted to build a barracks.  The prestige, wealth and military potency of the town resides entirely with the Riders Council, who exercise their (mostly) unquestioned authority through a democratic charade known as the Free Hostelries Cooperative Council. 

This Riders-led guild alliance includes the Vintners, Brewers and Bakers Guilds as well as the Free Innkeepers and a few other less well-established guilds.  It also has significant ties to mining interests and weapons manufacturing.

Westernmost province
Role in Story
Most remote and “other” part of the Saskan Lands. Mountainous, hilly. Where the [wind lords] and [herbalists] have their centers.  The source of both the main rivers. The source of change. The lacunae. The nothing-that-is. The empty set that makes unity always a matter of change and development rather than solidity.

Love. Healing.
Related Characters
Morning Thunder. 

Seasons
In the region around the upper [Barbo], idyllic rolling waters, hillsides full of plants, flowers, herbs. Not eternal spring, but something like that year-round.  
In the region around the upper [Bloo], the highest peaks in the Saskan Lands.  The snowiest region.
Unique Features
The only province that lies in part outside of the more-or-less recognized borders of Saskantinon. Not the only mountainous/hilly regions (see: Eelan, Bordaloon and Salofess), but the most mountainous and remote.
A good number of fairly well-maintained roads/paths run through the region. 
Description
The name “weyr” is borrowed from Anne McCaffrey’s fictional world of Pern. It implies that “dragons” now live or once lived here.  In my world, this serves as an allusion to the long-lost knowledge of / desire for flight. 
The “wind lords” of New Weyr and the region around the town will be a key into this part of the story, but I am still working through how to approach this in a subtle, interesting way. New Weyr is the only town located on a mountain. And like New Harvest, it will be concealing some secrets.  I am thinking caves/underground installations with allusions to both flying animals and flying machines.  
Sights
Main towns are New Weyr and New Harvest.  New Harvest sits above an underground town called Freedom.

Sounds
Many small waterfalls, rapids. Lots of non-sentient wildlife, though birds and flying insects are very rare. Many caves and some cenotes.

            <Text>Ring Road

A road that circles through the central lands of Saskantinon.  The major and minor paths that track close to it. 

The Ring Road and the location of paths, towns, regions, villages, hills, caves, hide-outs, secrets, underground caverns and so forth in relationship to them provide a harmonic framework for the story-telling.

The Ring is a core metaphor for the world of Mantemar, and of Saskiniton in particular.  It  features in myth, legend and song.

The Ring provides provides a mechanism for the development story arcs as characters explore and travel around and about it. 

Some of the key players trace a kind of passion play as they travel around the ring as members of the Riders Guild or other groups and organizations. 

I hope to make effective use of musical similes and metaphors loosely aligned to the metaphor of the Ring — key signatures, major and minor, the circle of fifths and so on — as way to develop stories and to enable and engender game play.

Related Themes

The circular, spiral nature of the game world is reflected in the physicality of the ring road.

The two rivers that circumscribe the ring roads provide a source of harmonic tones and melodies against the repeated instrumentation and chorus of the ring. If the ring is percussion and string instruments, then perhaps the rivers are woodwinds and flutes.

Let’s evoke classic views of the towns and rivers as seen from the roads. A visual “body of knowledge” maps the region in players’ minds.

Unique Features

Its history is buried in layers upon layers.

The looping circularity of the Ring Road has a metaphysical character. “It doesn’t go anywhere, but it covers everything.” 

Description

The Ring Road is largely paved. Although the materials are uneven they are have been worn to a smooth surface by the passage of countless generations of travellers. Going from points ‘A’ to ‘F’ on the Ring should evoke a certain kind of feeling. I won’t literally call this a scale, but that’s the kind of feelings I want to evoke, sometimes grand and happy, sometimes somber and sad. 

The minor roads and paths which criss-cross the Ring are sometimes paved, sometimes not. Smaller paths may be barely discernible.  These diversions may represent half-steps, sharps and flats, and provide the means for traveling along other “scales” that provide for different tones and nuances of feeling.

The Ring Road connects most of the main towns of the region. The lesser roads — the minor roads and paths — weave in and out from the great road, connecting the remaining towns and villages to the whole. 

The Ring itself is referred to in various ways … the Ring, the Passing, the Way, the Riders Realm, the 14 Towns, and more. 

Lands inside the major ring are referred to as Inner Sanskan, or the Skantaring, or by the names of the forests that make up most of its interior.   Those outside of it have a more diverse character, with each region most typically referred to by their own names and peculiarities. General terms for areas within the Lands of Saskantinon but outside of the Ring include Outer Saskan, Uiterring, the Frontier, and so on.
Sights

A traveler on the Ring Road sees signs of varying degrees of obscurity in a large variety of languages.  And all sorts of folks. Beggars. Travellers. Riders. Pilgrims. Night Watch and Day Watch.  Bandits, Thieves, Bards, Actors.   

The Ring Road attracts admirers of its antiquity, of its harmony, of its role in tying together the diverse constituencies of Saskantinon and binding them together against outside influence and threats.  
Sounds

Songs and tales of all kinds arise from the Ring.  Marching songs. Travelling songs and chants.  The rumble and movements of carts and oddly-shaped vehicles add an irregular syncopation to the more regular hoof-beats of those who ride mounts, drive herds or wear boots.  Every imaginable (name them) kind of musical instrument and voice.

 Less regular are reports of “sightings” of the legendary conveyances and bands said to have once travelled the ring, such as…

… the Shiny Chrome Train carrying the Irate Monarch — a long-gone but-not-forgotten ornery ruler of these realms who is said to have travelled in ring in sumptuous style. 

… the Flying Chariot of Airman Hector

… the Legions of the Reto Chair

… Charlie, who will come round again to restore to Metropolitan Charter

…and so forth and so on. 
Smells

Roadside inns, barkers and food merchants.  Smelly travellers.  Camp fires.  Gatherings and camps.

            <Synopsis>The Master of the Manifold Ways</Synopsis>
            <Text>“You scruffy old mage!”, said a very small voice in a syrupy iBark. 

Bewitched from slurping the initial tipple of s’lah, Barfalot glanced up with a half-smile.  A delicious sip of the Two Moons’ famous cinnamon-scented s’lah  has a fermented wallop of special herbs that’s enough to sit an old dog down on his hindquarters.
The friendly Jax was gesturing in a confusing way. His mind adrift with  the initial wafts of a cinnamon buzz, Barfalot watched the gesticulations with  amusement before his attention focused the liquidy accent saying,  “Down here, old boy. I haven’t grown an inch since we met last.  And at my age, I’m not likely to have any growth spurts.”

His head clearing, Barfalot looked down.  The proprietor stood next to the Jax, the top of the turkey feather adorning his cavalier hat just barely reaching above the Jax’s knees. How a diminutive gecko-sint had come to manage the most notorious Inn in the most infamous part of the Rika bazaar was an enduring mystery to many.  Not to Barfalot, who knew a great many things.  But to many other folks it was an enduring mystery. 
Still emerging from the initial s’lah-induced wave of nostalgic feelings, Barfalot considered that maybe he knew too many things for his own good.  And then he considered just the opposite. 
Neither thought helped to explain how he’d managed to forget the diminutive size of Master Kirill Geckster-of-the-Manifold Ways, proprietor of the Two Moons, prominent member of the Free Innkeepers community, and - some folks say - mover of recently acquired goods.  

Ever the coarsely-ground diplomat of song, Barfalot greeted his old pal with, “So. Still crawling through the cracks of the system, you fooken basimi scoundrel?  Or have you seen the light? Tell me brother-sister, that you’re  ready to embrace the Sacred Fire and I will fetch the Night Watch. Let’s let them know you’re ready to submit. Yes-good?”

The proprietor’s human features were distinctly gecko-sint, particularly his head, which was considerably elongated.  It melded into the torso in a way unusual for a puros.  The skin had a distinctly greenish and slightly scaly quality as well.  
Taking just the opposite approach to being impuros from Barfalot’s, the Master of the Two Moons chose to accentuate and celebrate his-her appearance with various fashion accessories:  along with the musketeer-style hat, it featured a swashbuckler get-up featuring an over-sized and brightly-colored cape and boots, a bandalero tool-belt holding little knives and other contraptions.  To top it off Kirill carried a, relatively speaking, large stick whose knobby jeweled end emitted a slightly blue and shimmery aura. Whacking the Jax’s hip with his glow-stick, which clearly gave them a jolt.  Kirill signaled the Lookie that the boss was to be raised up to the level of Barfalot’s nose. 

The free Jax squatted, then carefully lifted Kirill so that the Master of the Manifold Ways could stand on the clone’s thigh.
“Master Kirill, thank you for making time for me,”, Barfalot whispered, switching to an iBark argot known to animal-sint convicts who’ve spent a  number of turns in the Beet,  “I have serious tidings. Is there a place we can confer in private?”
“Let’s go,”  said Kirill and then yelled into the ear of Jax: “Take us to the garden.” and then gently whacked the clone on the head with that glowy little stick.</Text>

            <Title>Jax</Title>
            <Text>Jax
Indeterminate • many

Role in Story
Some comic relief, but also a mystery.

Goal
To serve. And to spy for the Created.

Physical Description
Human-like with a limited vocabulary in most cases.

Personality
Follows routine scripts in most cases. Not many realize that they have something of a hive mind.

Occupation
Most of employed as servers at inns, but also found in other menial tasks.
Sometimes employed as “red shirts” on quests/missions.

Habits/Mannerisms
Somewhat obsequious, generally humble. Appear/disappear without notice.

Background
Sent down from the bases of the Created in the Krunkinotto Mountains to infiltrate organic society,
a Jax has a minimalist pre-built memory reflective of the environment they are sent into. 
They are one model of cloned being. Others are considerably more dangerous. The main purpose of a Jax
is to collect info and report back to the main nodes. 

Internal Conflicts
Conflicting directions or complex philosophical questions can mess with a Jax’s programming, causing kernel panic and other types of crashes.  Their empathy AI components are the source of numerous fuzzy outcomes; some Jaxen can become very attached to specific organic life-forms.

External Conflicts
Most Jaxen eventually come to realize that they are not human and this can cause existential crises of various kinds. Generally, the central nodes recall them once their AI reaches this point of complexity. In rare cases, a Jax will resist being recalled; this can lead to a shutdown unit being sent to close them down. Some organic forms have a deep antipathy towards the Created and have no compunction about crashing or (in rare cases) re-programming a Jax.  The Agency is aware of the Jax problem but, along with a reluctance to interfere too much in planetary affairs, has not yet developed a virus or similar malware strong enough to penetrate the Code of the Created.

            <Title>Weather</Title>
            <Text>
The weather in Saskantinon is generally warm, but there is a change of seasons.  In districts closer to the Delta and the Bay of Bar, it is even warmer and can be very humid.  In the western hills and mountains and to the north , cooler breezes prevail and occasional strong winds, the occasional tornado are not uncommon.  It sometimes snows in these areas too, especially in the westernmost mountains bordering Aranzen and the Krunkinotto.  

The eastern part of the region gets rain fairly regularly.  Both rivers, especially near the Delta, tend to flood every few years. Generally speaking, the floodplain of the [Bloo] Northern River is given over to agriculture that depends on these occasional inundations.  The Souther River [Barbo], on the other hand, gives way to a complex series of small and large dams and canals, some of ancient vintage.  The Great Dam of Beaverton is a popular destination for travelers touring the Ring for its grand sights.
 
Though it seldom reaches as far south as the Southern River [Barbo], every once in a great while a deep freeze descends on the region.  This is generally considered a time of catastrophe in most traditions, both human and sentient.  The more militant forces of the Heliocastron tend to leverage such hard winters as a trigger for launching pogroms, which is to say an elevated Gleaming, against those perceived to have brought it on due to their connivance with “Moonic” forces. </Text>

            <Title>Roís</Title>
            <Text>Roís [family TBD]
20 seasons • Traveler/Refugee

Role in Story
Communicate the depredations of the Cloned/Manufactured who control the Kronkinotto.  Provide a window into life in the western hills.

A side-kick to Morning Thunder (or similar name) of the Eelan, who gathers together travelers and refugees from the western lands.
Goal
Tell a story of refugees that brings sense of compassion and equanimity to the grander tale. With this character, I want to develop a sense of caring/kindness for someone who is not necessarily easy to get along with or to sympathize with. 

Physical Description
Lithe, hungry. 

Personality
Angry, despises the Cloned, of course. Not at all sympathetic to other technologically-enhanced beings and apparatuses.  Has never had much to do with modified or enhanced or mixed sentients.  Tends to view all non-humans as possible source of food.

Occupation
Hunting, trapping, fishing.

Habits/Mannerisms
Speaks only Eeber. Morning Thunder is teaching him some Eebarq words.

Background
Refugee from a well-to-do rural / peasant mountain village in the mountains of western Bordaloon province. Family and most of the village was wiped out in a raid. Roís is the only survivor.  

Internal Conflicts
Bitter, angry about the destruction of his family and home. Neither the Riders nor the Volunteers protected them. His prejudices against non-“pure”-humans are challenged via his friendship/alliance with Morning Thunder. His anger is due in part to the fact that Roís’s behavior back in the village was not exemplary and may have played a role in revealing the location of their village to the Cloned.

External Conflicts
May have a sibling living in Mabhakol.  May be secretly in love with a Jax.

            <Text>Scatterling
A village in the province of Barboskanti

Role in Story
A place where [“the Green”], a philosophical school, has its center and where “the Mages Guild” gathers from time to time.

Related Characters
Main (open) guilds with an important presence in the village are Tailors and Herbalists. 

Season


Unique Features
Produces unique clothing known for its style and durability. 
The Herbalists of Scatterling are known for having cures that actually work against deadly diseases and infections. Continuing the theme of the façades of the place, these Herbalists front for one of the few active medical clinics, including surgeries, in the region.  

Description
Well-removed from Helioptic control, but with several layers of obfuscation and misdirection in its organization. The Mages who gather here are deeply infiltrated by the Green.  A Helioptic Scholar is in residence as well.  Mixed and formed sentients are respected, well-treated.  It is a place famous for its hospitality.   

Sights
Boasts two “ancient artifacts” of interest especially to Eelaners and other old-time-religion types:  a manual typewriter and a slot machine.

            <Title>Kam</Title>
            <Text>Kam
29 seasons • Givákala

Role in Story
A typical Helioptic believer and worker

Goal
Help to depict part of the great network that constructs the flying machines.  Tell a story of both assimilation and emerging identity, as well as fear of being “outed”.  Keep it complex. Kam does not hate the Helioptic community. He loves it, even though he feels estranged from it. 

Use his story to describe the gender politics/gender expression of the Helioptic community.

Physical Description
Hefty, solid with especially muscular legs. Having passed the age of presentatio, performed a ritual of exposure, and mated, he presents publicly as male without fear or shame. But expects use of male honorifics only with his work gang subordinates, since he is not in a position of leadership &amp; authority in any other context. 
Personality
Plodding but genuine and big-hearted

Occupation
Carpenter’s gang lead. 

Habits/Mannerisms


Background
Abandoned by his parents at a Helioptic brooder house near Khaliro as an infant, he was raised in the Helioptic tradition in a fairly fundamentalist way.  Although he seemed destined for the Guards due to his size and strength, a Traveling Sister of the Way of All Things convinced his brooders to direct him into the Carpenters Guild instead.  Once he finished his apprenticeship, the Guild sent him to Givákala where he works mainly constructing ready-made materials for Volunteer Camps. 

He is the parent of two broodlings resident in Givákala.

Internal Conflicts
He has some oxen DNA, which he has covered up his entire life. His feet are slightly cloven.  Conflicted about whether to reveal this to his offspring. Although he participates in Gleaming activities, it is with concern that some day he may be exposed as “star-crossed” himself.
External Conflicts
He has been visited twice by the Traveling Sisters since they directed him into the Carpenters as a youth. Both times he was given a mission to build a small but relatively complex piece machinery for them in secret, which he did.  One of his maters has discovered this side work and is now watching Kam carefully.

            <Title>Beet in Mabalbesq</Title>
            <Text>Beet
A town in Mabalbesq, on the border with Wesshewen and Norgyte

Role in Story

The town of Beet is located northeast of Borded on the border with the Wesshewen plains, basically in the middle of frikking nowhere.  Standing in the middle of the northern plains, right on the Weshewn border, this remote place’s mayoralty is held by a High Priest appointed by the Heliocastronic center to officiate its affairs, but “advised” by a permanent office of the Riders Guild, referred to as the Riders’ “Cadenza”.  

The northern part of the walled town — where the prison is located — is actually located across the border, according to official records. This bit of legality means that, to the extent there is any actual “law” in Saskan Lands, it does not apply to North Beet.

These two officials manage the town together from a joint office known as The Wardening, located next to the prison in North Beet.

Beet is not a place that many folk ever choose to visit.  Though there are regular inhabitants of the town who don’t work at the prison, and there is a sizable Holding to the south of Beet where both freeholders and indebted sentients work the land, it is effectively a penal colony jointly managed by the Riders Guild and the Heliops.  

People and animals from the various provinces, as well as foreign travelers who have been found guilty of crimes significant enough to be sent away, or who are thought to be serious security risks, are brought here to work the fields — mostly in the northern holdings, usually in chains. They also get rented out to southern landholders, where work conditions are not as bad and there are priosner-sympathizers among the rural population.   

Even more stringent types of restraints are hidden away behind the unassuming-looking walls of Beet.  Produce from The Beet flows mainly into the Helioptic provinces.  But since much of its output is routed through Borded, the Riders get their cut as well. 

Given its relatively large shaped-human and talking-animal population, plus the fact that it serves as a concentration point for malcontents, and despite the efforts of the Wardening, Beet is a node for communications within and between various subversive, criminal or otherwise shady and secret organizations.  

It is rumored that the Kilikon Mina, an extremely dangerous bitama outfit that is sometimes thought to be associated with the Heliocastron, have their headquarters here.  It seems unlikely, given that this is pretty much Rider territory, but who knows...

            <Text>Hopefully some of this can be generated by software. 

Don’t want to simply repeat / copy items found in Gamma World, though some “odes” would be appropriate. 
Don’t want to over-do, especially in the Saskan Lands. Leave more exotic stuff for the Lewshanana, the Form, the Krbsh Sea, Krbshanana and the Komexicon.

Part of the “twist” will be that some “normal” species (from the reader’s perspective) have been — or have been thought to be — extinct for a long time.  The revitalization of these species either due to recurrence of natural selection, isolation, or through the engineering of the Agency or other players — should cause as much shock/excitement as introduction of creatures that don’t exist in the reader’s world.

The big “twist” I am working with is the complete lack of flying creatures, even bugs, in the Saskan Lands and nearby. 

Not all “beasts” are “evil”. 

Some of the beasts I’d like to work with include:

- Carrion Vultures: basically the same as we have, but bigger and willing to eat larger finds
- Giant Ravens: likewise, but even bigger and even more sentient
- Giant Wolves: very dangerous
- “Land Sharks”: big snakes/worms that travel undergound. Very dangerous
- Lizard Bush: an aggressive and poisonous plant
- Dragon Bugs: very large insects, aggressive, a bit like the bugs in Starship troopers (accidentally introduced by early Agents)
- Jackalopes: pathological rabbits
- Orange Scarfers: pathological rodents

Largest town in Eibar province, near the confluence of the [Bloo] and the [Bighotti]

Role in Story
One of the oldest towns. Close to the eastern border and the Krbsh Sea. Get a taste of travelers from afar.

Related Characters
A number of characters who play a role in the Saskan Lands but come from outside of it arrive via Ingar. May also be a place where defectors, escapees go to — who are considering emigration. 

Season
Typically humid. 

Unique Features
Something of a safe haven for inbound and outbound refugees. Since it is so foundational to Eeberian culture and language, it is difficult for fundamentalist Sun worship to get a foothold. Think of its relation to mainstream (Besquohuk) Heliocastronism as something like that of Iran (prior to the mullah regime) and/or maybe Turkey to the Sunni-Arab-Islamic world — yes, we are believers, but with our own rich history and traditions thank you very much.  

Description

While not one of the largest towns, it has a lot of traffic, with three roads in and out and close to two major bends in the river. Also close to the border with Lewshanana. It is one of the few towns that has “suburbs” around it for some distance, rather than just rural villages and farms. 
Sights
The Great Holly Temple, featuring a gigantic drooping holly tree at its center, is an ancient elaborate structure that has been built up and around the tree for generations.  It is officially a Helioptic place of worship but the upper floors were appropriated by the “High Council of the Eiber Folk” many years ago.  

This is ostensibly a kind of low-key language academy, devoted more to collecting information about Eiber accents, dialects and so on than trying to enforce a “proper” Eibar. In reality, and obvious on the uppermost floors, it is more like a combination trading company / bank / insurance company, sponsoring multiple types of sea-faring and other expeditions on behalf of its board.  

The “High Council” plays an important role in financing (loans, credits, partnerships) throughout the northern and eastern provinces. It works with Kahila enterprises to some extent, but is very wary of basimi influences.  

Active/devout Heliocastronic membership is low as compared to other Helioptic centers. The Day Watch is active and visible, but mainly deals with ordinary law/order concerns.  The Night Watch is seldom heard from, dealing mainly with more obscure espionage concerns.  

The Gleaming is not observed in Ingar.  Instead, there is an annual voluntary public Confession in which Sun worshippers process to the River while chanting mournfully and punching each other in the arm. At the river they perform a ritual bathing, to wash away any “moonful and starry excrescence” that has accumulated during the past year. 

There is an Astrologers Laboratory in Ingar, as well as a variety of small, but well-attended Kahila and Barbasol temples and meeting-houses scattered throughout the town and its surroundings. There is even a “First Arrivers” community which seeks to build up good relations between Eibar and Oubar provinces.
Sounds
A busy, active place. Lots of coming and going. Lots of commerce. 

Smell
The occasional foul stench emanating from Lewshanana.

            <Title>Story Arcs</Title>
            <Text>Here is a summary of Vonnegut’s lecture on story arcs. I want to play with these in order to help bring some structure to writing the story about (Saskantinon, Arpeggia, Fretonia)…

Some basic advice on story-telling:
	⁃	Tell a joke
	⁃	Know your goal
	⁃	Tell a truth
	⁃	Make me care — emotionally, aesthetically, intellectually

Story arcs are emotional arcs. The y-axis typically describes ill-fortune (fall) and good-fortune (rise). The x-axis is time, from begin to end of the story.

Complex and popular stories may combine the 6 basic types of narratives sequentially. For example: Harry Potter stories.  But each coherent part of the overall epic is likely to follow one of the six basic patterns.

The most popular patterns are “Man in a hole” and “Cinderella”.  Cinderella is the most popular story arc in many traditions, especially western. Examples include:  creation myths and Christian redemption tales.

1. Rags to Riches.  Rise. Steady, staggered or precipitous rise from ill- to good-fortune.
2. Riches to Rags.  Fall. Steady, staggered or precipitous fall from good- to ill-fortune. 
3. Man in a Hole.  Fall, then rise.
4. Icarus. Rise, then fall. 
5. Cinderella.  Rise, fall, then rise.
6. Oedipus. Fall, rise, then fall.  

——

For Act One, I am thinking an overall Oedipus trajectory is what I am after. 

I want to introduce a number of the settings and characters — 

Multiple small falls and close-ups… Barfalot/the Mages &amp; Bards; the bazaar in Rikiki/the Basimi guilds/Kahilabarbakal/Kahila folks/ALF types; the Riders Guild/Borded/Jess and Jenn; the languages and writings/how sents can get sent up; and a bigger fall, but not a Really Big Fall:  the darker side of Helioptic justice and duty/Beet, Mizry, the gleaming — which also lets us know about the very real threats from Wesshewen, Krunkinotto and Lewshenana; 

Rise: the joy and wonder of the two rivers; the interplay between “Sun worship” and “Moons worship”, seen via travelers on the Ring and the rivers; getting to know more of the towns, with hints about others that are farther away from the Ring; a first glimpse at the port towns on the Krbsh Sea; the whole deal with the beavers of Beavertoon; the freedom of New Harvest — and the mysteries of Aranzen and other Southern realms;   

Fall: looking out from Besquohuk and Jook; the day of gleaming, the passion of Jess and Jenn


For Act Two, an overall Man in a Hole trajectory, with a Cinderella start.

Rise: The Kahila/Basimi rescue (of Jess, Jenn, others) from the gleaming. They are “born again”. 

Rise: Barfalot and crew pursue technology and alliances that will help to counteract the influence of the Heliops without weakening the humans (Riders, Heliops) so much that they will be open to attack from the North or the South. 

Falling/Rising: They encounter numerous difficulties, some losses. It starts to look like all is lost. We explore the death drive in some detail.  Then we encounter the Windward Angels / Wind Lords (not sure what I want to call them) &amp; the underground caverns, where new technology and new ideas are introduced. We get the first glimpse of what the Enclosure really consists of. 

Rise/Falling/Rising: A sea voyage takes place and we start to learn more about the rest of the world, about other evolved sentients, and get the first hints about the Agency.  This prolongs the suspense (I hope) in the sense that it repeats the fall/rise theme. The ship may be lost, but it’s not. The Sea may be full of monsters, but it’s not; it is the home of some important friends — taking us all the way back to the first scene with those onto-barmen.  We may fall off the edge of the world, or we may pass into a realm of horror/radiation, etc.. but we don’t. 

Rise: The new technology is both philosophical — not external revolution but internal evolution, not expanded consumption but expanded sharing — and technological/“magical”: flight. We meet a type of creature that has been missing throughout the story so far:  birds.  (Note to self: introduce an island or two of birds somewhere out in the Krbsh Sea).  And we meet the mutants at New Weyr who have some similar abilities — also perhaps levitation (introducing a magical element that can’t be easily explained) — are they holographs? Is it magnetism? Something else?  And in the underground — plans for gliders, kites, balloons, parachutes. 

Rise: We literally rise out of a hole at the end of Act Two as we see the first balloons rise and birds flying.

For Act Three, we finish with everybody’s favorite: Cinderella

Rise: The flotilla, on air and sea, makes its way towards Fretonia, while the basimi, the bards and beavers lay the groundwork for introducing change. It all looks exciting when…

Fall, fall, fall: Trouble strikes from multiple directions. An uprising of the clones is coordinated with an attack from Krunkinotto. Barbarian gangs and nomads from the Weshewen plains take advantage to press an assault.  An outbreak of monsters in Lesshewan causes trouble in the Northeast and a similar outbreak in the Forg makes waves for the seaborne. This causes political problems most of all — to be seen undermining the Riders and the Heliops at this point would not only be unpopular; it could embolden the enemies at the gate. The resistance is slowed down, put on hold in some areas, rand it is betrayed.   All this happens quickly, like an adventure movie that opens up with epic car chases and gun fights.

Trouble: Resistance is redirected to assist in the “national defense”.  The octo-led sea forces and their bird-allies redirect to drive the monsters back to the Forg. With the Riders and Heliop Volunteers having to defend the northeast against invading hordes, the basimi and assorted “dark elf” (Kahila) and “ALF” forces go to the rescue of the towns of the Northeast. Meanwhile, far from the center of things, the Windlords are assisted by the Aranzen (who have some “magical” qualities) in turning back a flanking attack from the Krunkinotto to the south. The conflict in the southern hills draws in the Riders of Eelan, who become aware of the considerable advances that have occurred due to Barfalot’s machinations. They defect to the “rebel” side. 

Trouble: Meanwhile, a “glass bead game” style showdown is taking place in Jook, involving the eldest advisers to the Heliocastro and the most senior learned members of the Reformed Beavertoon Academy of Historical and Juridical Cacography.  We become aware that incognito Agents are in attendance. They reveal themselves to some extent in order to influence the debate, by telling “parables” about worlds that could not be rehabilitated following their Catastrophical Eras. 

Rise, but oops still falling: The Rider and Heliop forces are victorious in the Northeast. Orders go out to arrest and otherwise subdue the basimi-led forces. The Helioptic Volunteers start moving en masse East to take over the battle against the monsters.  The debate in Jook is interrupted by a team from Besquohuk who lie so fast, so loudly, with such felicity — introducing the “new theology of post-catastrophic optimism” — that the Jook elders are taken in by it. When they announce the need for a “New Gleaming”, the Beavertoon philosophers begin to despair, and consider leaving and the Agents begin to draw up reports downgrading the place. 

Rising, but still trouble: Meanwhile, the clones have been defeated in the Southwest and the monsters have retreated to the Forg. The flotilla makes its way to the ports and prepares to defend the Kakila folk from the “New Gleaming” as reports begin to come in of the first massacres and so on.

Rising: As would be expected the Riders leadership refuses to participate in the “New Gleaming”, but does offer help in securing the Northeast. At this point they are confronted by the Riders of Eelan, who insist on a different approach and point out that a new three- (or more-) sided alliance not only makes the region more secure, but that there is no assurance the combined air and sea forces of the “rebels” could be defeated. 

Rise: The Riders agree. (Jenn/Jess) go the Great Debate, along with Barfalot, and offer a new vision to the assembly. Riders go to the Northeast, disrupt attacks against the Kahila folk, and together the Riders, the Heliops and the Kahila drive back the monster hordes.

Rise: The sky-flotilla re-emerges. Balloons, kites, banners, gliders — and birds — are seen all over Arpeggia, to the astonishment and delight of all.    The agents rewrite their reports.

Coda (riches to rags)

From the swamps of the Forg, a dragon-beast arises.

Deep in the underground bunkers of the Krunkinotto, a spy-Jax returns from Fretonia, with diagrams and blueprints of flying machines.  These are shown to a system that is developing something like rocket fuel.

            <Synopsis>Barkippers from Beyond the Edge</Synopsis>
            <Text>Master Kirill rode Jax’s shoulder while Barfalot slunk along behind.  As they passed the long bar on their way towards the back of the bar room, Barfalot cast a studious eye on the octopodish squad of barkippers.
Visitors expect to encounter the unexpected in the Land Between Two Rivers. It is a land of contrasts, a melting pot of cultures, languages and species and a relatively safe bulwark for enterprise, agriculture and trade. 
At the Inn of the Two Moons, deep within the Bazaar on the ‘starry’ side of the rebellious town of Rika, one would expect to meet the unexpected. Nonetheless, few things are quite as striking as the first sight of the barkippers at the Two Moons. 
In a world where human-looking sentient beings have evolved from many special cross-pollinations, in a time when science and superstition  merge and mix to such a degree that distinctions between the two are largely conceptual, it could still be startling to encounter, to put it poetically, if not quite correctly, a fish out of water.  

To be more precise, if less poetic:  an octopus-person out of water.  Much less six of them forming a kind of conga line and serving drinks. 
When a visitor orders a bowl of s’lah at the long bar of the Two Moons, it’s likely to be served by a team of multi-brained eight-tentacled denizens of the deep, creatures whose DNA is as much 40% from the order Octopada. Those patient enough to listen might even enjoy, along with their spicy intoxicating drink, a lugubrious story or two regarding the epic migration of the Tetricus family from their homeland, which they claim to be on the other ‘side’ of the world, that is, from beyond the Edge . They’ll tell tall tales of having traveled through many oceans to arrive the Bay of Bar and up the River Bloo. Settling at last, of all of the s’lah joints in all the lands, at this particular curve of the Ring of Saskantinon.

A lot of folks laugh at their stories.  Obviously, nothing can simply swim into the Mantemar from out there, from Beyond the Edge, Where Nothing Lives. Every sensible sint knows that the navigable world-ocean ends where the Great Wall of Fire meets the Cataracts of Doom, right near the Edge.  

Barfalot allowed a brief smile as he pondered the common wisdom.  He recalled what he’d learned from his years sailing The Forg with a crew of practical, if somewhat piratical, Shanowan mariners, regarding the Familia Tetricus.  He’d learned for example, that not entirely unlike the most hard-core Heliops among the puros, who prefer to keep their sexes binary and separate, the male and female members of the Tetricus clan tended by and large to avoid each other except when mating. 
Unlike the puros sun worshipers, though, who do so for religio-poltical as well as economic reasons, the story Barfalot’d learned was that the eight-leggers did so because the octo-lasses had the habit of occasionally dining on the octo-lads after engaging in the octo-sex act. 

As they made their way through the crowed room, he quietly shared some rare linguistic and sintological observation for the Lookie’s entertainment and education. The Jax nodded knowingly as Barfalot explained, 
“They have big eyes, short torsos, over-sized craniums, eight nearly sentient-in-themselves limbs each with a myter-long arm-span, not to mention a cozy habit of tightly co-inhabiting a space. Tetricusi octopods make for a formidable bar-keeping crew.  They exhibit some human characteristics:  air-breathing gills in a more or less human-like facial configuration, three legs are used to stand and perambulate, very basic vocal chords, and, at least in some cases, even some body hair.  They typically communicate in a squishy-sounding iBar,  with the Growlish accents common to  sea creatures in the region of the Kerbshana Delta. They tend to use a lot of gesticulations as well.”

The Jax waved his arms sympathetically, or jokingly, or in confusion, which made Master Kirill’s ride a bit bumpy. The proprietor reached out and bopped Barfalot on the head with his stick and bellowed, “ Can it, canine.  Nobody likes a know-it-all. ”
Doing his best to approximate the octopodo-impuros accent as he passed right by the end of the bar, Barfalot murmured loud enough to be heard by the octo-fellow at that end, “Hey man, cool scars you got there. How’s the wife?” 
This earned him a squishy chortling sound in reply, along with a gesture, which he thought probably meant either “Ha-ha” or “Jook off” or maybe both, followed by a spray of salty water, smelling of octo-breath, in his general direction.</Text>

Role in Story

(I am not thrilled with “Saskantinon”.  It is OK and I don’t hate it. But it doesn’t resonate with the undertones of musicality I’d like to introduce. Considering “Arpeggia” and “Fretonia” as  alternatives.) 

Located in the south-central region of Lurabar, east of the mountains of Krunkinotto and Aranzen, and west of the Jezidi'ivv River and the Krbsh Sea. In reference to the two rivers which flow through it, the Bloo and the Barbo, the Land of Saskantinon is also called The Land of the Two Rivers or variations on the names of the rivers, like Barbo-Bloo, Bloobar, Barbloo and so on.

The region is also referred to as the Saskan Lands, the Ringtoons (LOL - love this), the Saskantoons, the Rivertoons and various other names associated with notable aspects of its character in a synecdochel fashion, referring to the whole by reference to a part: 
	•	Jook — an ancient name, one of the oldest inhabited areas of the region
	•	Heliocastria — referring to the Helioptic powers that claim to rule the region
	•	Barbo — after the southern river and some of the sub-regions and towns 
	•	Bloorio — after the northern river and some of the sub-regions and towns
	•	Bordal or Borded — after the important Rider town of Borded
	•	Besquo or Beshkwoo — after the important Helioptic town of Besquohuk  

(Most of these names need work.)

Both rivers originate in the western mountains and flow into the Krbsh Sea. The southern river, the Barbo, drains into the Great Beaver Lake, created by the formidable dams built by the inhabitants of Beavertoon.  Along with its natural course into the Krbsh Sea, now by way of Beaver Lake, the Barbo also drains into, also by way of Beaver Lake, and provides navigation to, the Bay of Bar to the south. And there is a navigable canal that ties Beaver Lake to the Lake of Oo, near the border with the animal-ruled Syndicate of Krbshanana.  

For now, most of the action in the story and the game takes place within the Lands of Saskantinon. 

Importance of the Rivers
Just as the Ring Road ties together Saskan lands, provides a good bit of its security, energizes its commerce and ties together its diverse peoples and sentients, so the Two Rivers bring a flow of life into the region that goes beyond the obvious benefits of navigation, trade, fishing and irrigation. 

[Not thrilled with “Bloo” and “Barbo”. Again, something with more of a musical allusion would be nice. 
In Latin and Spanish, “barbo” resonates with “hairy” and “bearded” and “barber”. In Italian and Portuguese, with “barbel”, a type of fish. It is a family name in some traditions (Spanish? Irish?). A dog named Barbos is the star of 10 minute Russian comedic film from 1961; there is an Australian version of the story too, “The Loaded Dog”.
There is a cartoon character named Bloo. A clever, self-centered, cynical, greedy, immature villainous character. There is also a South Korean/Filipino rapper (in Los Angeles) in crew “42” called Bloo (Daniel Kim Hyunwoong).
It would be nice to have an etymology of river names that makes some kind of sense, maybe has some musical resonance, and doesn’t have any (undesired) negative allusions.
Not too big on the “Bighott” river either.]

The northern river, the Bloo, runs from the northwest to the east through northern Saskantinon. It originates in two main feeder-tributaries.  One, the Borbloo, originates in the Krunkinotto mountains.  The other tributary, the Weybloo, flows through the foothills of western Weyrlands, in an unnavigable but beautiful, entrancing series of mild waterfalls that goes on for miles and miles before reaching the rapids of Eelan and then the Mabhakol Falls, just before it flows under the Ring to join the Borbloo to form the Bloo.  While the Bloo  sustains a great deal of life in the Heliopticon it also brings with it river pirates and other challenges flowing down from the Krunki northlands and the western hills.  As a result  of such traffic the Bloo is almost as heavily patrolled by Helioptic and other Saskantinonian forces as is the Ring Road.

The southern river, the Barbo, originates in the hills where the wild western Weyrlands beyond the borders of Saskantinon merge into those of northern Aranzen, a largely human-run region to the southwest of the Saskan lands.  Legends, tales, traditions, songs and traditional sentiments of the region describe the Barbo as the lifeblood of the Bar-speaking regions of Saskantinon, Aranzen and Krbshanana.  Some traditions sing of it as the earth-soul and treat it as an object of veneration and even worship, similar to how the Weybloo is treated by some westerners.  In a demographic and pragmatic sense, the Barbo — along with the southern part of the Ring Road, marks the line between the largely human and human-appearing populations to the north of the river and the largely animal and mixed animal-human populations to its south, particularly in the Saskan region of Uitibarbo, bordering the Realm of the Komexenon, and the marshy region of Oobar, north of the Syndicate of the Krbshanana. 

Banks of the Rivers
As they flow through the Ringtoons, the Bloo and the Barbo mark both geographic and political divides. Only in the area around Beaver Lake do the same sub-regional language and cultural and economic norms appear on both banks of the Barbo.  As with the Ring Road, the two rivers serve as both boundary and transport; they provide a dividing-line as well as a common thread.  

A Ride Down the Bloo

A boat trip on the Bloo would start in one of two places.  Just east of the falls at Markbhol, near the delightful town of Qirol, just inside the Ring, where the Weybloo first expands into a navigable stream, not too long before it joins the Bloo proper. Or to the northwest of the fortified town of Borded, perhaps as far as the border of the Saskan Lands where the waters of the Borbloo spill dramatically down from the heights of the Krunkinotto Hills, rushing into the southern plains, where it forms a porous border between the two Rider-dominated regions of mountainous Bordaloon and the windswept plains Mabalbesq.  

The first great architectural site one would see would be Borded, the largest and one of the grandest towns Saskantinon, home of the powerful Riders Guild. The Borbloo passes directly past its elaborate walls, passing under the Ring Road at the Paladin Bridge near Borded’s impressive Southern Gate.  A winding and difficult river to navigate, one would still be steering very carefully as the Borbloo passes through the hills of southern Salofess before merging into the more peaceful, if considerably wider, Bloo. 

Continuing eastward, now well into the realm of the Heliocastron, on the right-hand, starboard, southern bank of the Bloo, sailors and their crew and passengers would see first the forests of the Borda Woods and then, after passing the richly appointed militaristic Helioptic town of Sungyte, the rich farmlands of Rotonabloo all along the riverbank for miles on end. Such bucolic scenes continue all the way to the grand town of Khaliro, a major Helioptic trading center, and then go on again for many more until reaching the town of Rutonik, where the Ring once again crosses the Bloo as it heads south towards the dense forests of Kahilibarbakal.  

The north, on the left-hand, portside bank of the Bloo, a similar but sparser and starker agricultural vista unfolds for the river-borne voyager traveling past Borded, Sungyte, Khaliro and Rútonik. The province of Jivákala, between the Bloo and the Ring, is home to major Helioptic military encampments. But they are far from the river, not visible to river travelers. What they would see from the boat are villages, farms, small encampments, and vast fields of grain for harvest and forage for beasts — a peaceful scene belying its purpose, which is to feed to Day Watch, the Night Watch and the Volunteers — the armed forces of the Heliocastron. 

Passing under the Bridge of Trees just east of Rútonik, voyagers on the river Bloo experience a distinct sense of passage as they move into the borderlands of Eebar.  These Saskan Lands face off  towards the Lewshanana delta to their north and east, feeding into the immense Gray Forest of the Jezidi’ivv River basin and beyond that, the startlingly imposing sentinels of the Lewshan Peaks, where, it is said, many monsters dwell. On a clear day, an observant traveller who’d thought to bring a looking-glass could see, away to the northeast, the tree line of the Gray Forest where it quickly deepens and darkens as it approaches the north-eastern border of Saskantinon with the Lewshan Lands, marked by the Jezidi'ivv River.    

After Rútonik, the Bloo widens considerably. Its traffic takes on a considerably busier, more mixed and cosmopolitan character, with traffic arriving from the Krbsh Sea and moving upriver to trade with the Saskantoons. The town of Ingar in the province of Eebar is the last mainland outpost of Saskan civilization a seaborne traveler sees before the Bloo merges with the Jezidi'ivv to pour into the Lewshanana Delta on the northern end of the Krbsh Sea. Assuming a traveller were then to voyage on into the Sea, they’d see the great tower of the Port of Blubar, which overlooks the massive Delta, guarding the entry into Saskantinon from the sea. If they continued south, hugging the coast, they might also see the smaller tower of the Port of Selaron in the Outer Ring province of Mobalbesq, and even further to south, they’d encounter the mouth of the Barbo, where it separates the Mobalbesq from the Isle of Wye. And here they would have definitively left the northern Eebar-speaking lands, characterized politically by collaboration between the Riders Guild and the Heliops, both organizations run by and for the benefit of human-appearing-humans, and entered the Oobar-speaking Saskan lands, where things are a bit different.

A Ride Down the Barbo

Our traveller who had set out from the Krunkinotto borderlands north of Borded, if they had survived all the way to Selaron and beyond, might very well encounter a traveler who had also begun a river journey far to the west, but further to the south.

The Weyrlands cross over the border of Saskantinon into the Lands of the Aranzen people — a fuzzy border. The border between the Krunkinotto — itself a vague concept — and the Weyrlands is also not entirely clear.  What is well-known is that the town of New Harvest (or Freedom.. or.. ?) is nestled in the foothills of the southern Weyrlands, just north of the border — such as it is — with Aranzen. One may book passage there for a ship on the Barbo.  

Unlike the enchanting rolling rocks of the Weybloo, the Barbo is navigable starting from a point just west of (New Harvest). It gathers water from innumerable small streams as it makes its way through the Aranzen Hills. This part of the voyage is a delight.  For a reasonable amount of bits, a player can book a “cruise” through these parts just for pleasure. 

Business gets underway when the Barbo passes directly through the town of Barbol, which sits on the Ring as it turns from South to East.  On the northern, left-hand, port-side of the river, just past Barbol, are the southern end of the Borda Woods, an important part of the Helioptic heartland.  On a clear day, the Sunny banners and flags of a sizable Helioptic military encampment are visible from the river . On the right-hand, starboard, southern side of the Barbo, north of the Ring, is the province of Barboskanti (Borbaskanti ?). It is the southern equivalent of Rontonabloo (or maybe just Rontana?), a rich agricultural region densely populated with villages, farms and settlements. 

Midway to Beaver Lake, the river passes by the town of Brokilly. It sits on the northern side of the river and watches over a minor road that joins the Ring to center of Helioptic civilization:  the province of Tobaloon, a region of immense fir and pine trees, where the Helioptic Offices reside and the great town of Bequohuk is located at the geographic center of Saskantinon. Brokilly itself, however, is in the province of Kahilabek, a place inhabited mostly by Kahila folk, that has been devastated more than once by conflict between the Sunny forces and those of various uprisings and rebellions. At present, it is peaceful thanks to a kind of order imposed by the Basimi Guilds, who find that they can conduct their “business” more effectively when there is something like a “free” territory, that is not perpetually at war, in which they can operate more or less unmolested. 

Many travelers along the Barbo visit the southern side of the river to get a sense of or to dig into to rich traditions of the Barboskanti culture.  They visit the northern side, in the Kahila lands, there mostly for, ummm, shopping. 

It might seem strange to some that a territory with a reputation for being “rebel-held” borders so closely to the very seat of Helioptic power.  How this holds together is not so strange when one visits the Guards Town of Brytook, just up the road from Brokilly, or when one sees the Helioptic military encampments all along the roads from Brytook to Besquohuk.  The Tobaloon/Kahilabek borderlands are heavily fortified on the Helioptic side.

A river voyager might be justified in feeling a bit tense as they travel further along by Kahilabek province to the north, and passing along into the more remote eastern part of Barboskanti to the south. Things appear a good bit wilder on both sides of the river as one passes further away from Brokilly.  Most folks know that the wild and woolly Uitibarbo Lands are just a bit further to the south, outside of the Ring, and beyond that are the Bay of Bar and the Realm of the Komexenon, places that are nearly synonymous with “the ends of the earth” for many players, who often are just barely aware of the vast geography of Lurabar, much less what lies beyond the Seas.

Such trepidations generally come to an abrupt end when a boat floating east on the Barbo passes under the Sobright Bridge into the Land of Beavertoon. Here the river widens considerably and the land on both sides of the river erupts into activity, with unusual and entertaining sites to amuse and delight anyone who is not averse to a culture and economy dominated by folks whose DNA is obviously beaverish.  The vast majority of beaverfolk are mixed sentients. They appear similar to humans, with only some exhibiting more dramatically beaver-like physical semblances such as large flat tails. Many echo the large sometime even black and wet nose, the small mouth and small eyes of their Catoridae ancestors, but on a distinctly human frame. However, their language, culture, economy and architecture is entirely distinct from all the other regions of the Saskan Lands. 

The town of Beaverton (Castor? Castorton?) is, along with Borded and Beaquohuk, one of the three Grand Towns of the region. Like the others, it could almost be considered a city. [Come up with a vocabulary for villages, towns, cities, farms, ranches, encampments, fortified towns, and so on that reflects the varied nature of rural life especially.]  It is certainly the most unusual of the three. A traveller on the Barbo first sees the extraordinarily tall and elaborate walls and towers and artworks of Beaverton off to south, but may be forgiven for not taking notice ,since they would soon be encountering the impressive engineering feat of the Locks of Beaver Lake, a series of canals leading into the Great Beaver Lake. 

(Use terms derivative from Castor.  Castoridae/Catorinae/Castor. .. not just “beaver”) 

First time visitors might think they had reached the Krbsh Sea rather than a lake.  It is that vast. Following along the shoreline the vistor experiences the rare joy of seeing Beaverton from the water. The city simply merges into the Lake. There is no discernible shoreline. Buildings, commerce, shipping, livelihood and everyday life dissolve together into the water’s edge and continue on under and above the water.    

A voyager can navigate their boat through the city, onto the southbound canal, that stretches for many miles all the way to the Port of Barqton in the remote and boggy swampland of Oobar, on the Bay of Bar, across the canal from the easternmost reaches of Uitibarbo province. A voyager taking this route would be a brave adventurer indeed, heading towards the mysterious southern lands of Krbshanana or Komexenon. Perhaps even an “off-lander” looking to “escape the Enclosure” and travel to the fabled continent of Bricot and beyond!

More likely, they would continue east across the Beaver Lake. Either to the Wye Canal, which leads into Oo Lake and thence, through the Marshlands, to the Krbsh Sea, or through the Eastern Locks and Great Beaver Dam, continuing down the Barbo, winding their way past the Isle of Wye to the south and Mobalbesq to the north, both areas devoted largely to sea-related trade and supporting a widely mixed population. 

The Mobalbesqua town of Morilly, still a good ways from the Sea, but remarkably close via road to that other “rebel province” — the densely wooded Kahila-folk land of Kahilibarbakal — is a common stopping-off point for loading up (or off-loading) goods and supplies for transport around the point, past Selador and Ríkila, typically for trading with Oobar-speaking lands, or even into the Eastern Lands… should one be foolish enough to want to deal with the inhabitants of the Forg, or to pass through the swamps and mountains of the Lewshanana. 

Some old ballads claim that it is possible to take a boat up one of the river ways of the Forg, and navigate through them to the Sea of Song, and from thence to other civilized lands of Luramar. Have we yet met a player who has actually done so?  Well-informed Agents think not.

            <Title>Heliocastron</Title>
            <Text>This needs a good bit of work…

The Heliocastron is the leading body of the Helioptic Union. Its membership is secret. Some people believe the Heliocastron is a single person, others say it is a Triumvirate or even a Committee.  The great town of Besquoa, located at center of the Ring, is where one finds an impressive Temple of the Sun, where the Central Offices of the Heliocastron are located.  

Most of the major towns on and within the Ring, including the lands and villages near the town, whether farmed by free-holders or vassals, is governed by a representative of the Heliocastron.  Titles  and honorifics for Heliocastronic Officers change from place to place, sometimes in recognition of special arrangements that have been made.  Such titles include:  Heliocastrophical Governor, High Priest of the Sun, Town Father, Helioptic Representative, Master of the Watch, Sun-Lord and so forth. 

The Helioptic influence is also strong in town to the north of the Ring, but less-so in the ones closer to Borded.  

Their presence is tolerated, for the most part, in the southern towns, but they are not given actual authority over local laws, customs, etc. for the urban area — there they act more as a religious authority for their community of believers 



In the towns of the Heliopticon everyday power lies not in the hands of the Heliocastronic Offices per se but in those of the multiple agencies and institutions who enforce the Law of the Sun as promulgated by the Center.  The strong arms of the Heliopticon are organized into five guilds: the Day Watch, the Night Watch, the Volunteers, the Agents of the Sun and Heliocastronic Specialists.  [Note: come up with better names using localized and more amusing lingo...]

The Day Watch enforce the law during sunlight hours. They are the beat cops, the visible enforcers of order.  A large guild organized into a multitude of ranks and positions, the Day Watch is active to a greater or lesser degree in every major Town except Borded.   In almost all cases, its members barrack in a walled compound of their own.  Along with being human-centric, the Day Watch is strictly gender-neutral.  The uniforms of the Day Watch reflect their rank, assignment and location.  But even folks in position of authority or who are partnered do not express gender while on duty.

The Night Watch, as one might expect, works at night.  In the Helioptic theology, their duty is to combat the evil coldness that emanates from the two moons and to protect the Sacred Fire, that is, the sunlight, from the dire influence of the night.  It is a much, much, ummmm, shadier organization than the Day Watch.  Including undercovers, infiltrators, listeners and agents in its ranks, the Night Watch sometimes wear distinctive attire but often try to blend in to their surroundings - always so in towns and areas not under strict Heliop control.  Whilst they share a barracks and a common command structure with the Day Watch, members of the Night Watch are much less obviously identifiable than their day-time comrades.  Along with being a very distinct organization within the Watch, most consider that they have a more marked tendency towards brutality than their Day Watch brothers.  Like the Day Watch, the Night Watch is officially a strictly gender-neutral guild and they tend to be more vociferous in their disdain for gender display than their daytime partners. 

The Volunteers, as their name implies, are the citizen-militia of the Helioptic community.  Called into service as needed, Volunteers carry out a wide variety of duties, including labor and repair chores along with enforcement duties.  In cases of emergency, they rise to what amounts to the national defense and in a very real sense are the 'soldiers' of the Helioptic Army.  Some Volunteers tend to take their responsibilities more seriously than others, identifying with the bravado of the Day Watch or the stealthiness of the Night Watch, depending upon their instincts and personalities.  Some Volunteers — those posted to military camps — are pretty much full-time soldiers. Attempting to rise to prominence in the Volunteers is a common path towards apprenticeship in the Watch.  Although still dominated by a gender-neutral culture, unlike the official Watches, the Volunteers do not expressly forbid gender expression and they tend to follow more closely “civilian” norms in this area, where folks in positions of authority or who are coupled are freer to express gender. 

The Agents of the Sun are tasked with being savvy about all activities throughout the Lands of Mantemar which can affect the prosperity and security of the Heliopticon of Saskantinon.  They  organize the defense of the realm, including industry, supply and arms-manufacturing.  The Agents are investigators, detectives, diplomats, bureaucrats, guild-leaders, engineers, analysts, politicians, office-workers/scribes, and managers — the professional class of the bureaucracy.

Something of a Praetorian Guard, the Heliocastronic Specialists, as their name implies, provide specialized services for the Heliopticon in general and for the Heliocastron in particular.  Little known to the general public, they are the internal support system for the Agents and for the Heliocastron, providing every type of “special” service needed to ensure the perpetual authority and security of the Heliocastronic Center. 

 
It is not incorrect to characterize the Heliopticon as an aspiring but not entirely successful theological-military dictatorship with important populist tendencies.  Its power is far from absolute.  Nor is its role and influence entirely dire. 

They really do protect the population – especially the human population, but also others under their protections – of Saskantinon from external and internal threats.  The Heliocastron rules over a relatively prosperous and secure region that is surrounded by threats. During tumultuous times, the Heliocastronic Center is perceived by many as a source of stability and protection.

The Watches of the Ring Towns – those towns which sit on or very near to the Great Ring Road of Saskantinon – along with the other armed forces of the Helioptic Union and those of the Riders Council who patrol the Ring and the Rivers, provide the main line of defense for the Heliopticon against external enemies.  With the major exception of Ríkila, where relations between the townspeople and the Watches are extremely tense, the Watch and the Volunteers – especially the Day Watch – are respected, by and large, for their role in defending the region from foreign incursions.  

There are a few towns and regions — mainly in the Weyrlands and Eelan — where Helioptic presence is almost non-existent.

The Night Watch tends to get some grudging respect for its role in looking into things that go bump in the night. 

Nevertheless, both arms of the Watch are justifiably feared by non-humans, shaped humans and all those who do not hold to the Helioptic faith. Judgments can be harsh and biased, especially during the Helioptic Festival days and the annual pogram-like “Days of Burning” known as “The Gleaming”. 


The traditional external threats to the region tend to come from the North and Northwest, in the form of wild beasts, raiders, pirates, bands of marauders, bizarre and frightening forces emerging from the impermissible mountains, and even the occasional full-scale invasion.  From the South and South-East, animal-liberationist gangs, sometimes autonomous, sometimes in the pay of the Krbshanana alliances, pose a potential threat.  Fears that one day they will see a unified, large-scale “animal”-led army arising in the south keep many an Agent of the Sun busy and sleepless.  As will unfold during our story [once I figure out more details… :-)  ] there is a ferocious and monstrous enemy lurking in the Lewshan Mountains to the northeast as well. 

Internally, the Watch tends to be concerned first and foremost with the Kahila-folk, a fairly large and enormously diverse group who mainly inhabit the provinces of Kahilabarbakal and Kahilabek, but are quite active in other eastern provinces too and play an important role in sea-borne trade. The Kahila tend to be non-believers and many follow or participate in a wide variety of “free”, “independent” and in a good number of cases, clearly illegal trades and guilds, up to and including organizations of assassins and hitmen, some of which are aligned with various “animal”-liberationist militants. 


In a few towns, particularly in the Kahila regions and most notably in the large town of Ríkila, the towns are divided into “Sunny” and “Moony” districts.  

Of the larger Ring towns – Borded, Jook, Beaverton and Rikila – along with several smaller towns and a wide variety of villages, some remote, some not so far from the Ring, do not “officially” recognize the Heliocrastron's right to rule over them.   In Rikila, this is disputed — in other words, the Central Offices do assert their “Watchful Rights” but the reality on the ground is different. 

In the case of the large and well-to-do town of Borded, a contract was established long ago between the “Free Hostelries Cooperative”, an important conglomerate of guilds led by the Riders Council, who built and run the town, and the Helioptic Union, who are permitted to operate there within restrictions.  The Riders Council runs a military organization that provides protection services, paid for mainly (but not exclusively) by the Heliocastrophical Agencies, throughout the Heliopticon and especially on the Ring Road and along the Northern River [Bloo]. Like the Helioptic Union, the Riders Council is dominated by humans.  

The two powerful human-run groups have a generally congenial relationship and not a small number of Riders hold to the Helioptic faith.  But especially in their stronghold of Borded, the Riders maintain strict autonomy from the Heliops in matters of military organization, in business and in guild affairs.


Well inside the Ring, surrounded by deep forest, lies the ancient town of Jook.  Bardsongs of ancient Jook are among the best-known in the region.  Jook-legend songs are sung in nearly every village and town of Saskantinon.  While many of the Jook bardsongs are probably entirely fanciful, the sheer number of such ballads and ditties reflects the place that Jook holds in the imagination of the region.  It is far and away the oldest of the towns of the Heliopticon, a fact that is obvious from its strange and tumble-down architecture.  Its old iconic structures, many still showing evidence of building materials of unknown manufacture or origin,  predate, possibly by many, many centuries, those of the other towns in the region. 

A quiet, almost mystical place, the Heliocastronic Representative to Jook is always careful to acknowledge the precedence of the quasi-mystical [Order of the Ancient Elders of Jook] in town affairs.  However, Jook Town is almost entirely populated by Sunny faithful, albeit this is often a kind of polite cover over more ancient beliefs having to do with respect for the Elders.


Whereas the situations in Borded and Jook are clear-cut, Ríkila is another story.  There the Heliocastronic Offices are engaged in a state of constant civil strife.  The town sits astride the inside side the Ring, mid-way between the rivers and connected by a smaller road to the Krbsh Sea.  

Ríkila is an important entrepôt for trade and travel between the Heliopticon and the populous sentient-dominated Lands to the east – the barely-“civilized” Owshk-speaking region of Lewshanana – and to the south – the powerful Grummik-speaking alliance of the Krbshanana.  Furthermore, all factions, religions, secret societies, banned guilds and malcontents of every description have a guild hall of some sort, often not amounting to more than a seedy pub or disreputable temple, in Ríkila.  It is – some say literally – where worlds collide. 

The town is literally split in two, with one half under the watchful if somewhat paranoid and draconian rule of the local branch of Helioptic Watchers and the other basically a chaotic and anarchistic bazaar where Oobark is often spoken openly and without fear.


The town of Beaverton, located on the southern Ring and spanning the River Barbo, likewise refuses to officially acknowledge the rights and privileges of the Heliocastron.  In this case, the majority population – primarily a large, vivacious community of sentient-beaver/human mixed who built much of the town – dominate business and politics in the town and also control much of the traffic on the river.  

It is suspected by some that the Beavertonians, whose Town Council officially espouse equality between humans and septs and does not militantly promote anti-human politics, are actually  heavily influenced by mountain-dwelling, shaped-humans who inhabit the Aranzen mountains far to the west of Beaverton.  In other words, they are under suspicion by the Helioptic Union (and some members of the Riders Council, too) as being something of a fifth-column for “mutant” Aranzenian influence, rather than simply as animal-liberationists.  Unlike Ríkila with its frequent rounds of protests and street brawls, occasional uprisings, and its noisy bazaar and an infamously bawdy night life, Beaverton is relatively peaceful, conservative and hard-working,   

The Beaverton Town Council considers itself the proper authority in Bearverton.  The leading citizens tend to align themselves with the Night Hall, a guild co-operative that is outright banned in many parts of the Heliopticon.  While the beavers and the 'The Fair Wind', as the Night Hall is referred to locally, do not openly oppose the presence of the Helioptic Union in Beaverton, polite protests against and even occasional boycotts of Helioptic Scribes and Innkeepers erupt from time to time, usually organized by fly-by-night groups with verbose names like 'The Beaverton Youth March for Equality and Justice’ and such.

Role in Story

Military outpost run by the Riders Guild, with the veneer of being run by the Heliopticon.  A Helioptic Scholar officially presides over the camp and there are barracks for the Helioptic Volunteers there.  But in Camp Borda the local offices are entirely manned by the Riders Guild “on behalf of” the Heliocastronic Center.

   Despite its relatively mundane appearance as a well-kept military enclosure, the camp contains some interesting and sophisticated resources. As with Borded, though less obviously so, it is very difficult for strangers to approach the camp  undetected.  Unlike Borded, entry into the camp is not permitted without invitation.  The camp is a military outpost that also provides certain types of specialized training, mainly for Riders but also for Helioptic Volunteers and others willing to pay for the privilege of having access to Rider training, technology and techniques.

About This Template
By default, when compiled (File &gt; Compile), this project will generate a document in the standard manuscript format for novels. Settings are also provided to make it easy to compile to a paperback-style PDF for self-publishing or an EPUB or Kindle ebook.

How To Use This Template
	•	Inside the “Manuscript” folder, create a new folder for each part of your novel as direct subdocuments of the Manuscript folder. Two  folders have already been created at this level for you, with the placeholder title “Part”. You should rename these with the titles of the parts of your novel.
	⁃	Note: The “Manuscript” folder is what we refer to in the documentation as the “Draft folder”. It’s just been renamed “Manuscript” in this template.
	•	Create a new folder for each chapter inside the relevant “Part” folder and title each folder with the name of the chapter. If you don’t intend to use chapter names, just use something descriptive that tells you what the chapter is about. (You do not need to—and indeed shouldn’t—title the folders “Chapter One” and so on, because chapter numbering will be taken care of automatically during the Compile process.) The first chapter folder has been created for you with the placeholder title “Chapter”.
	•	Create a new text document for each scene inside the chapter folders. (Upon export, scenes will be separated with the “#” character for standard manuscript format, or with a blank line for other formats.)
	•	Information about characters can be placed in the “Characters” folder, and information about locations can be placed in the “Places” folder. (These are just regular folders that have had custom icons assigned to them using the Documents &gt; Change Icon feature.)
	•	Character and setting sketch sheets have been provided which can be used for filling out information about the people and places in your novel. These are located in the “Template Sheets” folder.
	⁃	You should not edit the documents in the “Template Sheets” folder directly unless you wish to change the templates (which you are free to do—you may wish to customise the sketch sheets or get rid of them entirely).
	⁃	To create a new character sheet, click on the Characters folder (or wherever you want to create your new character sheet) and from the Project menu, select New From Template &gt; Character Sketch. This creates a new character sketch document for you to edit and fill in with your character details. You can create setting sketch sheets in the same way.
	⁃	Alternatively, you can just click “Add”, or hit cmd-N, with the Characters or Places folders selected.
	•	A “Notes” folder has been provided for project-level notes. This has been set as the default Bookmarks folder in Project &gt; Project Settings, so that when you create a new document from the Bookmarks sidebar in a Quick Reference panel, the document will be added to this folder.

Compiling
	•	Title pages and front matter are all provided in the “Front Matter” folder (between the “Places” and “Notes” folders). Different front matter is used for different formats.
	•	Tip: You can open this document in a Quick Reference panel and have it open alongside the Compile panel if you need to refer to these instructions while compiling.

	•	To compile to standard manuscript format:
	◦	Edit the “Title Page” document inside the Front Matter/Manuscript Format folder to ensure that it contains the correct information (by default it will use information from Contacts).
	◦	Go to File &gt; Compile…
	◦	Next to “Compile for”, select “Print”, “PDF” or one of the rich text file formats such as RTF, Word or OpenOffice.
	◦	Select either “Manuscript (Courier)” or “Manuscript (Times)” from the list of formats on the left (note that this list changes depending on the file format you chosen).
	◦	Ensure that the “Add front matter” button is ticked under the contents list on the right and that the “Manuscript Format” folder is selected in the pop-up button next to it. (This has already been set up for you.)
	◦	Click on “Compile”.

	•	To compile to paperback PDF format:
	◦	Edit the front matter pages contained inside the Front Matter/Paperback folder.
	◦	Go to File &gt; Compile…
	◦	Next to “Compile for”, select “PDF”.
	◦	Select “Paperback (5.06” x 7.81”)” from the list of formats on the left.
	◦	Ensure that the “Add front matter” button is ticked under the contents list on the right and that the “Paperback” folder is selected in the pop-up button next to it if it. (This has already been set up for you.)
	◦	Click on “Compile”.

	•	To compile to ebook format:
	◦	Edit or remove the dedication page contained inside the Front Matter/Ebook folder. Feel free to add any other front matter documents as required.
	◦	Import a cover image (preferably in JPG or PNG format).
	⁃	You can store this anywhere, but it makes sense to place it in the “Ebook” front matter folder. A placeholder cover image is already provided—you will want to delete that once you have imported your own.
	⁃	Be sure to check online for recommended image sizes, because the recommendations are constantly changing. The sample cover image provided is 2,500 x 1,563 pixels, based on Amazon’s recommended size and proportions for a Kindle cover at the time this template was created.
	◦	Go to File &gt; Compile…
	◦	From the “Compile for” menu, select one of the ebook formats.
	⁃	To create an ePub file, choose the “ePub 3” format.
	⁃	To create a Kindle file, choose the “Kindle KF8/Mobi” format.
	⁃	“ePub 2” and “Kindle Mobi” are older versions of the formats. They are mainly provided for supporting projects created in older versions of Scrivener.
	◦	Select “Ebook” from the list of formats on the left.
	◦	If you have front matter documents other than the cover image, ensure that the “Add front matter” button is ticked under the contents list on the right and that the “Ebook” folder is selected in the pop-up button next to it. If you don’t have any front matter documents, you can un-tick “Add front matter”. (Un-ticking this does not affect the cover image.)
	◦	Above the contents list in the rightmost header bar are six buttons. Click on each of them in turn to go through the various available settings, changing what you need. In particular:
	⁃	Fill in the metadata such as author name and book title.
	⁃	Ensure your cover image is selected and shown.
	◦	Click on “Compile”.

Making Changes
There are various minor changes you can make to tweak this template so that it better suits your needs, as follows:
	•	Project and author name: The default book title and author name used in headers and elsewhere can be edited in the metadata pane of Compile (click the tag icon in the rightmost header bar of the Compile panel).
	•	Chapter subtitles: By default, Compile for this template is set up so that chapter numbers are added but not chapter titles. If you want to include the title of the chapter folder in Compile:
	1.	Click on “Assign Section Layouts” at the bottom of the Compile panel.
	2.	Select “Chapter Heading” in the list on the left.
	3.	Select a different layout on the right, such as “Chapter Title”. (These layouts determine how each part of your manuscript looks in the compiled text.)
	•	Part titles: Likewise, by default part numbers are added but not their titles. To include the title of a part:
	1.	Click on “Assign Section Layouts” at the bottom of the Compile panel.
	2.	Select “Part Heading” in the list on the left.
	3.	Select a different layout on the right, such as “Part Title” or “Part Title Page”.
	•	Font: You can override the font used throughout a compiled document:
	1.	At the top of the “Section Layouts” pane in the centre of the Compile panel, change the “Font” setting.
	2.	Note that fonts are not included in ebooks, however—e-readers choose their own fonts (and you would need to pay a hefty fee for a licence to embed a font in an ebook). The “Font” setting is therefore not available for ebook formats.
	•	Page size: The “Paperback” format is set to create a PDF with a page size of 5.06” x 7.81”, which is one of the formats you can use with Amazon’s CreateSpace and is a popular size for trade paperbacks. You can create your own paperback format using a different page size as follows:
	1.	Ctrl-click on the “Paperback (5.06” x 7.81)” format in Compile’s “Formats” list.
	2.	Select “Duplicate &amp; Edit Format…”. The window will change size and content.
	3.	In the “Format Name” text field at the top, change the name to something meaningful (e.g. “Paperback (6” x 9”)”).
	4.	Select “Page Settings” in the sidebar.
	5.	Click on the “Page Setup…” button.
	6.	In the “Page Setup” panel that appears, select “Manage Custom Sizes…” from the “Paper Size” pop-up button.
	7.	Click the “+” button to add a new custom size and give it a name.
	8.	Enter the paper width and height. (Note this is Apple’s standard Page Setup panel, and the units it displays are determined in System Preferences under “Language &amp; Region” &gt; “Advanced…”.)
	9.	Click “OK” and then click “OK” again.
	10.	Click “Save” in the Compile panel. This will return you to the main Compile preview. You now have a variation of the paperback format using a different page size that you can use at any time with any project.
	•	Making your own special folders: The “Characters” and “Places” folders are just regular folders that have been set up in a particular way; you can create other folders that work in a similar manner.
	1.	To create a folder with a custom icon, add a new folder, place it where you want it, ensure it is selected, and then go to Documents &gt; Change Icon to choose a different icon.
	2.	To create your own template sheets, create a new document inside the “Template Sheets” folder and set it up however you want (e.g. add text, change the title or icon, set default metadata and so on). Now this document will be available as the basis for creating new documents from the New From Template menu.
	3.	To make it so that adding a new document to the folder created in (1) always results in a document based on the template set up in (2), select the folder and go to Documents &gt; Default Template for Subdocuments, then choose the template document you created.
	•	Working with chapters instead of scenes: By default, this project is set up so that you write each scene as a separate text document. If you don’t like to break things up quite that much and would prefer to write an entire chapter in each text document, make the following changes:
	1.	Rename the “Scene” documents to use your chapter titles and move them so that they are on the same level as the “Chapter” folder rather than being inside it.
	2.	Move the “Chapter” folders to the Trash. You should now just have a “Part” folder with your chapter text documents inside it.
	3.	Create a new text document for each chapter.
	4.	Go to Project &gt; Project Settings and select “Section Types”.
	5.	Select the “Default Types by Structure” tab.
	6.	Delete “Level 3 files and deeper”.
	7.	In the “Section Type” column, change the setting for “Level 2 files and deeper” to “Chapter”, then hit “OK”. This tells Scrivener that all your files contain chapter text, not scenes. Compile has already been set up to apply the right formatting to the section types defined here.
	•	Using a custom table of contents in ebooks: When exporting to ebook format, Scrivener automatically generates a table of contents. If you would like to customise what appears in the contents, follow these instructions:
	1.	Create a document for your table of contents inside the Front Matter/Ebook folder.
	2.	Name the document “Contents”.
	3.	In the binder, select the documents you would like to appear in the table of contents (hold down Command to select more than one document).
	4.	For a simple flat list, hit Cmd-C or use Edit &gt; Copy. Alternatively, if you would like the table of contents indented to match the binder structure, go to Edit &gt; Copy Special &gt; Copy Documents as Structured Link List.
	5.	Click into the text of the “Contents” document and hit Cmd-V or use Edit &gt; Paste. The documents you wish to appear in the table of contents will now appear as a list of links.
	6.	If you intend to export to an older ebook format (ePub 2 or non-KF8 Mobi), select all of the text and change it to use a 12-point font.
	7.	If you wish to centre the table of contents, select the text and centre it.
	8.	In the Inspector, change the “Section Type” of the “Contents” document to “Table of Contents”. Now, when you Compile, your custom “Contents” document will be used instead of the automatically-generated one. The titles in the links of the “Contents” document will automatically be updated to match those of the final compiled ebook.

Sample Documents
The “Sample Output” folder inside the Research folder contains examples of documents that have been created by compiling from this template. “Standard Manuscript” shows the results when compiling to “Manuscript (Courier)”, and “Paperback Novel” shows the results when compiling to “Paperback (5.06” x 7.81”)” format.

Final Note
Scrivener project templates are flexible and are not intended to restrict you to a particular workflow. You can change, delete or move the files and folders contained in the template to suit how you work.

Like all templates in Scrivener, this project was originally created from the “Blank” template. We’ve simply added a few folders and set everything up in ways that should be useful to novel writers. Everything you can do with this project, you could equally do by creating a “Blank” project and setting it up yourself.

You can create your own templates by setting up a skeletal project with the files, folders and settings you would like to use for new projects and using File &gt; Save As Template.</Text>

Large northern province, bordering Wesshewen

Role in Story

Norgyte is the home of two major military encampments on the border with Wesshewen. Both are controlled/managed by Helioptic authority.

Unique Features


Description

Like Mabalbesq, Norgyte is mostly a wide-open plain of grassy plains.  Wind, rain, even tornados are not uncommon, though its reputation as a having a “harsh” climate is way overblown. 
Also like Mabal, Norgyte has been the site of numerous armed conflicts and has a reputation as the “bulwark against barbarism” — it is the martial center of the Helioptic Volunteers, in their traditions and songs, it represents the Heliops’ ability to keep the Saskan Lands safe and whole. 

Sights
By area, Norgyte is one of the largest provinces in the Saskan Lands.  Mostly very rural. Roads are not so good. 

The large border town of Hadika is located on the border between Norgyte and Saloriza to the east.  It is far and way the most metropolitan part of the province.  Like the province, Hadika is very much a military-oriented and Helioptic town. 

The small town of Mixry is located in the southeastern corner of the province, just north of the Ring.  Kind of an odd place, really, it consists largely of a huge ancient tower where many of its residents live and work. 

Sounds


Smell
Norgyte is the center for meat-production in the Helioptic Saskan Lands. As such, there are some fairly gross locations (slaughter-houses, meat-packaging facilities, meat-drying farms, etc.).

            <Text>Kahrn
Age • Barbol/Heliohlan

Role in Story
Rural Barbaros person caught up in the machinations of a Heliop town. We meet the mother/father when they come to visit the son/daughter who is being held in Heliohlan, as well as a variety of Bordawoods Helioptics.

Goal
Introduce the herbalists community. This will be a way to interweave love of gardening into the story-telling.  

Physical Description

Herbalists come in many sizes, shapes, forms.  Love of gardening, use of herbs for healing and so on is a practice that crosses over the religious/ideological/genetic divides. There are both Sun-worshipping and Moons-worshipping herbalists, and from other traditions too.  Generally speaking their knowledge and practices are similar — they can learn from each other and provide one of the bridges between communities.
Personality
The herbalist family are from the Barboskanti countryside outside of Barbol, between the Ring and the River.  This is an Oober-speaking area where devotion to the Earth-Soul is very strong.  

Occupation
The offspring had gone across the river looking for [a special type of herb] thought to grow only in the Borda Woods, in order to treat an illness in the village back home. One thing led to another and it ended up being a trip all the way to Heliohlan — maybe at the invitation of some kind Helioptic herbalists? Maybe an opportunity to get a job with higher pay / greater prestige than could be obtained in short time going through the lengthy apprentice process back home. 

One there, things got a little dicey. 

Habits/Mannerisms


Background

Kahrn’s story intersects with Barfalot’s travels to the west
Internal Conflicts
The son/daughter has knowledge of the location of some of the rare roots of Terpinol, a legendary “magical” root vegetable said to grant longevity.  This is not something to be shared with the shorter-lived Heliops, but s/he is tempted to do so.  May be a love interest, Romeo/Juliet situation. 

External Conflicts
Tried to leave town without permission in a strictly-controlled Helioptic town — Heliohan. Taken into custody. Had to pay a fine but didn’t have the bits. Released due to help from Helio-herbalists, but still forbidden to leave town.  Must report to the Day Watch every week, which includes indoctrination into Sun-worship.  Parents come to help him/her get home, are disappointed/afraid of the extend to which offspring has been both abused by and won over by the Heliops.

            <Text>Henqu
26 • Borded

Role in Story
Provide a rhythm tying together events around the Ring, insight into the life of a Ring Rider.

Goal
To hear that lonesome whistle blow. To be persecuted for the sake of justice and redemption. To endure a passion and become a savior.

Physical Description
Lanky but physically strong. Male/hetero, un-partnered but likely in love with Iohane. Like all Ring Riders, outward appearance/presentation is gender neutral. Usually seen only well-armored and armed. 

Personality
Reserved most of the time, to the point where some folks think he may have a mystical “starry” side. Boss-sheriff when necessary. Tries to remain even-headed and even-handed. Feels that both Heliop fundamentalists and Alfie-type extremists are “messing things up for the rest of us”. Drinks too much but sings like an angel.

Occupation
Ring Rider.

Habits/Mannerisms
Correct, somewhat laid-back in a cowboy-detective sort of way.

Background
From a poor herding family in the Bordaloon. Left home to reduce burden on the family and escape rural poverty. Easily recruited into the Riders since he already had skills in beast riding and fighting. 

Internal Conflicts
Henqu has become increasingly “errant” with respect to the Code of the Riders. He has come to understand that he has some mild mutations.  Although not strictly forbidden by the Code, it is pretty heavily discouraged and not disclosing one’s “abnormalities” is a violation of the Oath of Openness.  He loves and admires the Riders Guild and everything that Borded stands for, is worried about his standing if he “comes clean”, concerned he will be relocated to the outer provinces or assigned a less-responsible task.  Ring Riders, in particular, are discouraged from partnering-up. His evolving relationship with Iohane presents another potential “errancy”.  As the great conflict erupts and the “defection” of the Eelan occurs, his loyalties are stretched to the breaking point.
 
External Conflicts
Henqu is effectively a cop and something of a detective, as well as a bit of a spy for the Hosteleries Cooperative and other Rider-affiliated guilds/businesses.  He has had multiple run-in’s with neer-do-well’s, bandits, corrupt officials, bullies, legalistic eager-beavers (literally) who question Rider authority on “their” section of the Ring, psycopathic Helioptic fanatics, sociopathic Alfie extremists, traumatized refugees, and so on and so forth. When rebellion erupts in Rikila, he is torn between sympathy for the Kahila-folk and orders to maintain status quo w/respect to relations between Riders and the Heliocastronate.

            <Title>Morning Thunder</Title>
            <Text>Morning Thunder
Uncertain • New Harvest/Freedom

Role in Story
Personification of the Earth-Soul of Barbasol tradition

Goal
Bring a perspective on the role of women, girls, female gender in the Saskan Lands.
Strengthen and deepen the “herbalist” story lines, emphasizing the critical importance of ties to the land, the earth in order to prevent catastrophe.
Physical Description
Very tall, big, curvy. Expressly feminine appearance. Can be combative if necessary.
May have some raven or similar DNA.  Speaks all the languages of the region with great facility.
 
Personality
Somewhat Falstaffian. Fond of s’lah, of which she is a provider of a potent herbal blend. 
Has had multiple lovers and many children. Gets along fine with humans but is especially fond of mixed sents.

Occupation
One of the leading personalities of the New Harvest matriarchal society, Morning Thunder is an important political figure in the western lands and well-known throughout the southern lands as a coordinator of many free/independent (non-Helioptic) herbalist collectives. The free southern herbalists are not exactly a “guild”, more like a self-governing member organization a la the Mondragon model.

Habits/Mannerisms
Often busy handling a wide variety of concerns relating to her town, her large extended family, her friends and lovers, the broader political and military situations, and the business of the herbalists collectives.  Works hard, plays hard, travels a great deal and usually makes a big impression anywhere she goes. Not subtle. A strong but fair negotiator. Has numerous gifts of healing as part of her herbalist kit.

Background
Nobody really knows how old Morning Thunder is or how she came to be. Some regard her almost as a goddess. Legends, songs abound about her. Some folks are surprised when they meet her, having assumed the tales about her are fanciful. MT herself has little recollection of how she came to be. It is a dream-like memory of emerging/coalescing out of chaos and growing/evolving with a wide variety of human and animal influences. She is often drawn to the river and participates in some of the most popular/ancient Barbasol rituals. She ages very, very slowly.  She was created as part of Agency interventions several centuries ago, but she doesn’t know this.

Internal Conflicts
Being so long-lived brings its own kind of suffering in that she has seen many of her acquaintances, friends, lovers and children pass away. She feels the pain behind the Catastrophe like a personal event, and though she disagrees with their cosmology, their politics, and their gender culture, she appreciates the concern that Heliops have about preventing its re-occurence. 

External Conflicts
Some factions within the Heliocastronic Center see her as a threat due to her enormous popularity amongst females in particular.  They spread counter-propaganda aimed at smearing her reputation.

Role in Story

Develop a rhythm, a cadence, a set of sounds that helps to give a feeling to the place. In developing place-names, a kind of glossary of common endings that helps to identify a region and its population.

As I get more depth, reflect this in the types of names of organizations, of songs/ballads/legends as well. 

Language reflects and even creates philosophy and art. Work on specific words, concepts that might be uniquely reflective of the sense of a place, or of an aspect of the story that is rooted in a place, or of a feeling I am trying to evoke.  

Not looking to go “full Tokien” but nor do I want to just have sort of standard D&amp;D naming. I do want to play around with allusions to musical concepts.  I do want to be a bit silly in this regard (“Ringtoons”, “The Box of Jook”, etc.) since part of my fantasy is that the game — and the stories — will have a musical “resonance”.   

The overall conceit I am working with is that the entire world is, in fact, the creation of a group of Agents who were tasked with stitching this world back together after significant social and ecological catastrophes nearly destroyed it.  And that this is in fact just one of many worlds where they have had to do so, and they are not “gods” in any meaningful sense, just somewhat-advanced sentients tasked with “urban renewal”, if you like, who are just doing the best they can.  Not quite as silly as “Hitchhiker’s Guide”, but more in that vein than, say, “Game of Thrones”. 

In some way, I’d like for language - and playing with language - to be an active part of the story-telling and a dynamic aspect of the game play. This will need to develop of course. I don’t want to “stop the machine” to work it all out ahead of time.  But I am interesting in introducing algorithms, rules, hints/suggestions, a poetics that help to build up the language and dialects. 

Related Points
Am not intending to develop character sets or full-blown phonologies at this point, though that might be fun and could be quite interesting.  I did have some code at one point that did a little bit of this and might come back to that.  

For starting out, the rule is to keep it as simple as possible.  Write about the languages and dialects. Make mastery of them a useful skill like any other for a character to have.  But pay more attention to providing entertaining and descriptive names, concepts, etc. in English than trying to come up with neologisms at every turn.
Description

The major languages of the Saskan region — Eeber, Eebarq, Oober, and Oobarq — are in the Bar (Ber?) family of languages.  Minor members of the Bar language family are Aber, Khaliber, Juuker, Salober and Ellaber.  (All of these names are subject to change.  Try playing with -er instead of -ar. Oober? Ohber? Ober? Eeber? :-) )


Eebar.  Eebar is the language spoken by most humans and human-appearing residents of Saskantinon, as well as by most other residents, of whatever genetic mix, who live north of the River Barbo and east of Kahilabarbakal, and with the exception of Kahilbek and Beavertoon, where Eeber is common but Oober is more pervasive.  It is the most widely-spoken language in Saskantinon.

It is the native language of the northern and western regions. As the official language of the Heliocanoptic scribes it is the language of power in the region.  While it is not the first language of Beavertoon, many of the residents of that province, especially those involved in jurisprudence, are experts at it and may speak (and write) it even better than, say, a rural farmer from Rontona or a rancher from Jivákala. 

The standard accent of Eeber (Eiber?) is that of the province of Eebar (Eibar). This is mildly ironic.  Eibar was one of the earliest settlements of Ber-speaking humans in the region. Their pronunciation and idioms became the norm.  But as the centuries passed, Eibar itself became considerably more diverse, absorbing immigrants from Wesshewen, Lewshanana, Krbshanana and places even further away. These days, it is not unusual to hear all kinds of Eeber accents in Eibar itself, including Eebark. 

The other Eeber-speaking areas of Saskantinon have regional accents, in most cases minor variations in sounds and a few idiomatic words. The only ones that might come close to being considered full-fledged dialects are spoken in some of the more remote hills and valleys of Eelan, the Weyrlands and Bordaloon.


Eebark.  In the easternmost areas of the Saskan Lands north of the Barbo, in the provinces of Blurbaroon, Kahilabarbakal, Mobalbesq, and Beavertoon, but not so much in Eibar Province, it is more common to encounter shaped and mixed humans, which is to say sentients who are visibly genetic hybrids of humans with other species, than in other Eeber-speaking provinces. 

Within these areas, players with a more distinctively non-human-animal appearance, especially if they wish to emphasize their distinction, tend to favor the Eebarq dialect. Though Eebarq is mutually intelligible with Eeber it includes a number of phonemes rooted in other-than-human modes of utterance. Eebarq also has a welter of alternative phrasings and words, and some grammatical constructions, that would be considered “slang” or “incorrect” in “proper Eebar”.

Oober.  South of the River Barbo, Oobar rather than Eebar is the universal language.  Oobar and Eebar are closely-related members of the same language family. While they are mutually-intelligible to some extent, Oobar and Eebar are distinct languages.  The distance between them would be roughly equivalent to that between Spanish (Castillian) and Catalan in our world. 

Native Oobar speakers who need to interact with Heliocastronic officers or with human guilders who have trouble understanding Oobar are well-served by learning to communicate using Eebar.  It is not uncommon for Oobar-speakers to have some command of Eebar, especially if they travel much or do business with humans, as having this facility helps to smooth over and avoid difficulties interacting with humans and especially with Heliops.  It is rarer for a human, especially for a Helioptic true believer, to speak Oobar.  But it is not unheard-of, especially for Heliocastronic authorities or emissaries posted to Kahila lands or other non-Helioptic-majority provinces.

Just as Eebar province is the original home of “properly spoken” Eebar, so Oobar (Oubar) province is the birthplace of “correctly spoken” Oobar. It is believed by some sects of “First Arrivals”, as they call themselves, that the earliest mix of human and non-human DNA emerged from within the vast Salt Marshes near the Lake of Oo. And yes, it is sung that in centuries past, before the beaverfolk built the Wye Canal and flooded the plains of Oo to create Lake Oo, these many square klicks of mushy, salty marshland were called the The Oozes. Whether it is truly as the First Arrivers say or not, the Oobar language certainly appears to have emerged from this area and then spread across the southern Saskan Lands. It is still the main language used in Oobar province. To this day the residents of the town of Barqton pride themselves for being the hosts of the Oobar Language Academy and resist any attempts by Beavertooners to claim intellectual ownership over the langauge, even though most would agree that, as in so many other academic areas, the best Oober language schools are probably in Beaverton.

The Oobar language plays an important role in the liturgy and legends of the Barboskanti region and is closely identified with Barbo-centric belief and faith systems more generally.  A type of liturgical Oobar developed in eastern Barboskanti, where it is preserved, developed and taught especially within the cultural and religious meetings centered in the town of Barbol. 

Beavertoon natives are taught both proper Oobar and proper Eebar along with their own mildly distinctive Beavertoon-inflected dialect of Oobar.


Oobarq.  Further to south, in much of the unruly Uitibarbo area and in some of the northernmost areas of Grummik-speaking Krbshanana near the province of Oubar, a more growlish dialect of Oobar is spoken — known as Oobarq.  While some human-appearing-humans learn Eebark out of sympathy for their shaped and mixed colleagues and friends, or just in order to be clearly understood in certain environments, the Oobark dialect is in regular use almost exclusively by sentients with obvious and visibly non-human forms.  It is especially common for those players with “animalistic” features — as opposed to more “unnatural” non-human features, shapings or modifications. 

Along with its additional complexities of vocabulary, Oobark’s selection of animal-centric phonemes can be more difficult for humans to master as compared to than those used in Eebark.  

Furthermore, the offices of the Heliocastronic Watches, especially the Night Watch, consider the use of Oobark little short of insurrectionist.  A human speaking it inside the Ring in Helioptic provinces would certainly fall under suspicion, and could easily fall subject to hold in most Heliop-controlled towns and neighborhoods.  Being heard speaking it after sundown would most certainly get a player into hot water, possibly even marked for renewal in the next Gleaming. Even if not being actively sanctioned by the local Watch, a human-appearing sentient speaking Oobark even during the day is likely to fall under suspicion of being a pseudo-animal by residents of those regions.

Whilst spoken most commonly in the far to the south , below the Ring, as they say, it is not at all unusual to hear Oobark spoken anywhere south of the Barbo and even to a degree in the eastern sea-faring regions of Mobalbesq and Blubaroon.  In Kahilabek and Kahilabarbakal, the use of Oobark is not common. But neither does it being the kind of opprobrium as it does is in other Eebar-speaking areas.  Along with the more tolerant views of the Kahila folk, there its use tends to have a distinctly political overtones as well, but in an entirely different context.  Given the proximity of the two Kahila regions to the centers of Heliocastronic authority, speaking Oobarq  in the Kahila lands tends to be a way of demonstrating, particularly amongst the youth, an “up yours” attitude towards the Helioptic offices and watches.  It is often admired by peers as a “smart” or “hip” or “cool” thing to do amongst youngsters trying to make a reputations for themselves amongst the basimi and bitami outfits that make these putatively “rebellious” regions their base of operations.  It is not always considered so “smart” by basimi elders in those regions, who generally prefer to keep a low profile.

For the same reason, the use of Oobark is popular amongst the more extremist of the self-styled animal-supremacists and animal-liberationists, even amongst those for whom it is not their native tongue, though this tends to be the case in more rural areas far from oversight from the Watch or within earshot of Sunny border guards.


Doribah.   Eaiya is a language family that uses pitch and tone as the primary mechanism for constructing words and concepts, with phonemes playing a secondary role. As such, the basic set of Eaiya languages are very different from the Ber family of tongues. To players hearing an Eaiya language for the first time, it may sound more like what we might think of as a kind of jazz singing than a spoken language.   

This type of language is common in the western high mountainous region known to Bar-speakers as the Krunkinotto, among those beings who are said to have emerged from pre-catastrophic times after long hibernation underground.  

Ahber is a minor member of the Bar family spoken only in a few valleys of the Weyrlands beyond the borders of Sasakantinon, while Dorimea is an Eaiyan language common in the southern Krunkinotto, especially amongst Jaxen who have emerged amongst the Aranzen. A syncretic mix of Dorimea and Ahbar, originally a kind of pidgin, developed into a language of its own that does not fit neatly into either language family: a language called Doribah. It is one of several languages spoken by the Aranzen people, who live in the sparsely populated hilly country to the southwest of Saskantinon, near the Weyrlands.   

It is not unusual to encounter travelers and traders from Aranzen ain the western districts of Saskantinon.  There is regular cultural and economic exchange between Aranzen and the Saskan provinces of The Weyrlands. Aranzenners speaking/singing Doribah pop up regularly in the Barboskanti town of Barbol, which sits astride both the Ring and the Barbo not far from the border with Aranzen.  They can also be heard in the Uitibarbo port of Terpinol, which looks out for Saskan interests on the Aran Sea.  

Though travelers from Aranzen seldom travel inside the Ring — at least not openly — bards in both the Eeber and Oober traditions incorporate some elements of Doribah into their songs, both for musical effect and in order to encode messages that might be difficult for listeners to detect if they are not in-the-know regarding Doribahn tonal syntax. 


Growlsh.  Growlsh is a member of the Grumsh language family.  It spoken in the Krbshanana Peninsula, within the Krbsh Sea itself and in parts of the Forg and southern Lewshanana. Saying that something is growlish implies that it has a strong non-human aspect to it.  Saying that it is barqish is a much milder statement; it simply means that the speaker has an intentionally animalistic or even just an“exotic” accent.

            <Title>Heliopticon</Title>
            <Text>The Heliopticon
Role in Story
The main political entity within the land of Saskantinon, the Heliopticon — also referred to as the Watchtower of the Sun, the All-Seeing Eye, and so forth — is a theocratic bureaucracy that is both benign and malignant. It sponsors numerous social and economic and military organizations and institutions.  It advocates for and promotes an elevated role for non-mutated human beings within the social order, and within that, promotes a “traditional” type of familial hierarchy within its faithful cohorts as well — though not of the type that we are familiar with. 
The hierarchy serves to enshrine the authority of a select group of elites, mainly men who follow a certain type of ascetic lifestyle. They guard their technological advantages carefully, play on human fears of sentient-animals, and do so in the context of a doctrine focussed on Sun-worshipping metaphors.
The Heliopticon is a bit of a Rorschach test.  It is ia convenient kind of target for rebel story-lines, and certainly plays a major role in that sense.  But there is a sentimental-nostalgic aspect as well, drawing on multiple monotheistic themes that will be familiar to many players and readers. It is not the unreconstructed “evil empire” a la Star Wars.  For one thing, it is on a much smaller scale.  It is more like a national entity that has a troubled past and include many dicey characters, but also feels “like home” to many.
Key Features
The Heliocastrophical power which governs the Heliopticon is not only pro-human, it has an overt bias against re-shaped or modified humans, as well as against fully-shaped (cloned, android) entities, and against both fully-sentient animals and  manifestations of animal-human mixes. The most fundamentalist of the Heliops favor a 'return' to what they perceive as a 'pure' humanity.  

Helioptic science promotes a Sun-centered view of the universe that rejects ideas identifying the Sun as one star amongst many.  Some fundamentalist Heliops tend to be deeply opposed to vegetarianism, which they take to be a sign of pro-animalism, and to star-gazing or astronomy more generally, which they take as a sign of feeble-mindedness.  In the Heliocrastic cosmology, the stars are simply holes in the night canopy. Their light — obviously — comes from the Sun.  Less-sophisticated Heliops also tend to be superstitious about ‘evil forces’ which they understand to be emanating from the Two Moons.  

The Heliopticon is a militarized theocracy that frowns upon heresy and apostasy, and is willing to take violent actions to defend its privileges and its ideology.  It lacks a preponderance of public support and does not have a monopoly on either force or technology. Nevertheless it provides both physical and economic security for many humans in its realm of influence, and successfully benefits from the propaganda of fear it regularly promotes.   A less-obvious role of the Heliopticon is that its family social policy provides for a very controlled means of population growth. As we learn as the story unfolds, this is no accident. 

The general feeling promoted by the Heliops needs to be more like “Here Comes the Sun” than “Deutschland Uber Alles”, but it is a smile that masks a tension.  The “Gleaming” needs to come across in the way that witch-burning or heretic-burning must have seemed to pre-modern societies — that it is a protection against “evil” and even a (gory) kind of entertaining spectacle. 

Despite the intention and desires of Heliops, the Land of Two Rivers is quite diverse both genetically and ideologically. The power of the Heliocastron, as the high offices of the Heliopticon are called, and its many watchers, specialists, agents, officers and other minions is far from total. The region seethes with intrigue, contrariness and revolutionary sentiments, as well as more open and less dire types of counter-veiling forces, from the agro-feminists of New Harvest  (Freedom) to the busy beavers of Beavertoon to the Riders of Borded, and more. 

Some of the towns and villages in the region have a large degree of autonomy from the Offices of the Heliocastron, though these types of situations are seldom without their troubles.

Description

The town of Hadakik (or Hadika, depending on your dialect) sits on the border with Wesshewen, near the western foothills of the Lewshan Mountains, in what is sometimes called “The Shadow Lands”.  Its holdings are all on its southern side of the town. There is no opening in the town's walls towards the north or the east. 

The town’s only gate, to south, sits on the Mixry Road, which is the border between Norgyte and Salotriza.  

Hadakik is very much a military town and part of the martial traditions and lore of both Norgyte and Salotriza, though in the popular imagination it is probably more closely associated with the Songs of Service and the Obligation of a Volunteer, a song cycle and a long solo vocal piece, respectively, honoring the Volunteers.  

It has a long history as a front-line defense against raiders from the north and “monsters” from the east.  The Chief of the Watch is the undisputed and leading Helioptic official here.  With its large Day Watch and two permanent barracks for Volunteers as well, there is a disciplined military aspect to most activities in the town.  The Riders Guild also has a significant military presence her, where they collaborate closely with the Helioptic militias. 

The dominant guild alliance in Hadadik is The Candle-makers Craft Hall, commonly referred to in the militant anthems that tend to make up the the jaunty Bardsongs of the Northern Gate as “The Three Lights”.  Including the Armorers and the Cobblers, along with the Carpenters-Candle-makers guilds, the Hadadik Craft Hall is an effective military supply organization. It produces high-end, heavy-duty metal armor such as chain- and ring-mail, all types of leathery and bony things, along with exquisite short swords and knives.  The continuous demand from both the Heliops and the Riders for military equipment guarantees that such guild business thrive here. 

Hadakik is not a closed town.  The  trade carried on by the Hadakik Candle-makers Craft Hall is conducted with partners from all around the Ring. Hadakik hosts one of the best-known and best-supplied arms bazaars in the Saskan Lands.

            <Title>More Themes</Title>
            <Text>Reading Zizek’s book on Hegel has given me a number of ideas for psychological, literary, cultural and philosophical themes that could be interesting to weave into the story. 

The idea of “Enclosure” resonates with the history of capitalism, of course, and has some obvious thematic weight along the lines of reading a story about a set of characters who are, more or less, invented/controlled by unseen observers, so the story itself kind of breaks down both the 4th wall of authorship as well as playing around with the structure of “god-maker” video games. 

At the same time, it plays with post-apocalyptic genres, situating itself in the “zookeeper” kind of style. Humanity (and other sentient life on Earth) is saved (from the “Flood”) only through the benevolent oversight of a “big Other”. But that is also when it gets interesting.  The Heliops fear the big Other, deny that it actually exists, while creating a symbolic appearance (petit objet a) where the impossible resides, using the most obvious metaphor of all, the literal “big Other” — the Sun.  The variety of “stargazers” are more Kantian — understanding the “gap” in noumenal terms, that it is something “out there”, fundamentally not part of phenomena, something “else”, mysteriously “other”, to be “believed in” “on faith alone”, etc.   

Our Saskan Hegelians, Derridadists and Badiouites express varieties of understanding the “not-all” of the Enclosure in more materialist terms, as a “twist” that will reveal the benevolent nature of the Universe, as a “difference” that reflects our own sentient split between subject and object, as the harbinger of an “event” that will change everything in the blink of an eye, and so on and so forth.

His thoughts on the development of western music are also intriguing and might help to flesh out the “bard song” elements of the story.    Likewise, multiple references to jokes, iconic plays and films. </Text>

            <Text>Luvcandorandagan the Shanowan 
29 • New Weyr

Role in Story
Develop the story of the western lands as well as some hints into “foreign lands”, in this case Shanowa.

Goal
Provide a link to the Agency. Trigger some deeper philosophical inquiry.

Physical Description
Entirely human, but of an appearance not common in the Saskan Lands. Has a “foreign” accent, laughs more easily than most in this region, who tend to be a bit reserved/quiet. 

Personality
Inquisitive, opinionated, cynical. Has little patience with prejudices but is well aware of dangers and threats. 

Occupation
Ostensibly, a black marketeer of sorts, trading in custom-made cutlery and (small) weapons. 

Habits/Mannerisms
Enjoys banter with folks who can carry on an interesting discussion. 

Background

A spy from one of the Shanowan Lands, Luvca’s basic mission is just to gather info on the Saskan Lands. 
Luvca is also knowledgeable, to some degree, of the actual nature of the Enclosure and has been enticed with an offer of a trip to an Agency space station upon successful completion of mission to Arpeggia.
Internal Conflicts
Is not entirely sure if the info he has about the Agency is true/accurate. Was told to not reveal any aspect of it folks in Arpeggia but is finding it difficult to do so as trust is built up with the “Wind Lords” and honest, if misled, Stargazers and Mages.  
Also, has become fond of the Kahila culture, especially in Ríkila, and is becoming involved in intrigues relating to resistance against the Helioptic Watch there, despite instructions from home to stay neutral in any conflicts.  

External Conflicts
During travel from Shanowa to Saskantinon, Luvca became well-informed about the dire threats developing in the Lewshan Mountains. Understanding the need for relying on the Helioptic and Rider forces to counter the monsters creates conflict with contacts, friends, allies who in conflict with them.

            <Title>Kirill Geckter</Title>
            <Text>Kirill Geckter
32 • Master of the Manifold Ways

Role in Story
Something of a comical character due to his/her small size but large personality.  One of Barfalot’s connections to the underworld — especially the “thieves guilds” or “Annaka” in the local vernacular.  Kirill is one of the overtly “animal” characters, being 40% gekkota (gecko) and proud of it.  I am curious to see if I can play a “raven’s game” in the story-telling, in the sense that the sexual identity of characters becomes apparent (a) only once they reach a position of authority or leadership and (b) only once they choose to reveal it. This will be a pervasive characteristic of the fantasy world, but one that will hopefully come as something of a surprise to readers.  I see Kirill as a means to kind of introduce this concept. 
Goal
Kirill helps to reveal two important social organizations within the world: the Free Innkeepers/Hosteliers and their relationships to the Riders of Borded; and the varied world of the Annaki organizations, ranging from those basically supporting the resistance of oppressed species and poor classes, in some sense the representatives of the “rabble” in Saskantinon, to those merely obsessed with power, riches, lust and so on. 
Physical Description
40% gekko, with greenish skin, thick torso merging into the head with little neck. No eyelids, long tongue that is used to wet the eyeballs. Short by human standard, huge for a gecko; about 3 feet / 1 meter.  Dresses extravagantly with bandaleros and a cavalier hat. Something of a “Puss in Boots” stereotype — need to make sure there are enough distinctions, and that the character is sympathetic enough to not simply be a parody.  Short human-like limbs. No tail.
Personality
Commanding in a friendly way.  Always has an eye out for interesting acquisitions. 
Occupation
Owner/Proprietor of the Inn of the Two Moons in the rebellious town of Rika. Leader of the Annaka Intimi (“Master of the Manifold Ways”), a thieves guild that is closely tied to various rebel factions.  Senior consultant to the eastern free innkeeper bookkeeper fraction of the Free Hosteleries Cooperative Council. 
Habits/Mannerisms
Kind of a squeaky/chirpy voice. Likes to talk, hum and sing.  Knows multiple languages. Prefers warm temperatures.  Needs warm clothing if temps drop below (70 F); can suffer serious harm in freezing temps; fear of winter.  Moves very quickly, including walking backwards. Adept at climbing.  Tends to be active at night and sees well in the dark. Fruit &amp; honey are preferred diet. For protein, prefers to eat insects.  From a parthenogenic line that makes no distinction between sexes. Prefers the gender-neutral pro-nouns ze, hir, dey, dem. (Note: maybe develop equivalents in vernacular and use those in the text?)
Background
Like all gecko-sints in Kirill’s line, ze was abandoned at birth. Emerged from the egg in an underground tunnel inhabited by rebel rabbits (vegetarians), who helped to raise hir.  The legendary ALF leader Mother Hare was one of hir mentors.  A quick wit, ability to move silently in many directions drew attention of some Annaki-affiliated hares, who recruited hir at a young age.  Ze eventually became appalled at their lack of devotion to the cause and disagreed with their intense hatred of all humans.  Some rough turns led to Kirill’s encounter with Barfalot at the Beet Farm, who later introduced hir to some Rider-Innkeeper elements in the eastern towns.  Kirill used a combination of skill and, umm, politics, to become the sole proprietor of the Two Moons.  Once established in a (semi-)legit business, ze founded the Annaka Intimi (roughly, “the band of siblings”) 
Internal Conflicts

Complicit in criminal affairs which leads to a never-ending soul-searching to find an ethical balance.
Highly intelligent and sympathetic to all, but often rejected by puros for being “too animal”

External Conflicts
Often in conflict with Helioptic authorities and compelled to call on influence with Riders for protection.
Also often in conflict with rival criminal gangs, and sometimes “on the hook” to do favors for those who aren’t criminals, but could expose hir. 
Legal work running the Inn is burdensome, some conflict with overwork vs. desire to live a more “natural” life in the countryside.
