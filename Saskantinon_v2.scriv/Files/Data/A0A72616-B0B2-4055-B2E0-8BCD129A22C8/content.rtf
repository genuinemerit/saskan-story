In a few cases, they have a religious-spiritual character and act on an ideology aimed at suppressing vice, heresy or wrong-doing. Pretty much any armed force not associated with one of the major players (Borded, Beshquahoek, Byenung, the Empafarasi) are considered basiji.\

\f2\i Jax
\f1\i0  - the familiar name by which all Lookie's are addressed.\
\

\f2\i Jaxen
\f1\i0  - popularly refers collectively to all the Jaxes/Lookies. For those in the know (a small minority) it also refers to the machinic intelligence headquartered deep under the Krunkinotto Mountains who manufacture the Jax Lookies as well as other wholly machine-created intelligences. \
\

\f2\i Huum
\f1\i0  - the huum genotype. \
\

\f2\i Impuros
\f1\i0  - The relatively quantity of non-huum DNA in a sint. The higher the level of impuros, the less likely the sint is to be huum-appearing.\
\

\f2\i Kahila
\f1\i0  - a broad tribal designation for huum and sints living in and originating from the Kahila Lands, two provinces that have long been actively at odds with the Heliopticon. Fiercely independent, the Kahila follow folk-ways distinct from but also in many cases syncretic with the other main cultural currents in the Saskan Lands. Considered a lawless community by many. Tied economically to many underground and black markets.\
\

\f2\i Lookie
\f1\i0  - a creation of the Jaxen, all named Jax. Lookies have a very huum-like appearance and limited cognitive ability as compared to a full-blown huum or sint. Lookies share an identical phenotype with many other lookies. There are only 4 known models. In our story, with help from Stanley, one such Jax Lookie takes a name (Remanj) and begins to develop a unique personality. More formally: Lookalikes\
\

\f2\i Outlander
\f1\i0  - huum and sints from the Outer Lands and surrounding provinces. These are all a part of Saskantinon. They are "outer" in the sense that they share a maritime geography, bordering on the Krbsh Sea, and a corresponding worldview that is distinct from Helioptic, Borded and Southern norms. It has a hint of being Kahila-influenced as well.\
\

\f2\i Machinic
\f1\i0  -- refers to animated, life-like creatures, sometimes with a semblance of sentience, which were entirely manufactured out of non-organic materials. What we would call robots.  Jaxen are machinic. Some widely-used riding and carrying beasts are known to be machinic.  There are many bugs spying on huum and sint society on behalf of the Jaxen which are generally not known to be machinic. The Central Intelligence of the Jaxen is, of course, machinic.\

\

\f2\i Seff
\f1\i0  -- An octopus-huum sint with a high degree of impuros.\
