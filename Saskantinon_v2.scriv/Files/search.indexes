Type • Main Locations

Role in Story

One of the leading "state" powers, along with the Fatunik Authority, among the huum population.  The term "Rider" denotes not only a profession, which it is, but is also a kind of "national" and tribal identity.

Together with the Fatuniks, the Riders played a key role in leading the migration to the Saskan Lands over 4,000 years ago, following the Catastrophe. Their main town, and the largest and richest one in Saskantinon is Borded, the headquarters of the Riders Council.

It is an important trading, manufacturing, distribution and banking town, along with being a heavily fortified garrison. 
Relationship to Other Organizations

Central leading organization of Borded, the surrounding provinces, the Rider Union and the Rider Arms.
Description
Somewhat shadowy in that they take their security very seriously. But not as occulted as the Masters of the Fatunik Authority.  Their members are known publicly and they are all folks who have risen through the ranks of the Rider Arms or the affiliated groups within the Rider Union, largely through merit.

            <Text>Languages

Role in Story
A rhythm, a cadence, a set of sounds helps to give the feeling of a place. In developing place-names, a glossary of common endings helps to identify a region and its population.

Reflect this in the types of names of organizations, of songs/ballads/legends as well. 

Language reflects and even creates philosophy and art. Work on specific words, concepts that might be uniquely reflective of the sense of a place, or of an aspect of the story that is rooted in a place, or of a feeling I am trying to evoke.  

Not looking to go full Tolkien. Nor do I want to just have sort of standard 'exotic' D&amp;D naming. I want to play around with allusions to musical concepts.  I want to be a bit silly (Ringtoons) since part of my fantasy is that the game — and the stories — will have a musical resonance.   

The overall conceit I am working with is that the entire world is, in fact, largely the creation of a group of Agents who were tasked with stitching this world back together after significant social and ecological catastrophes nearly destroyed it.  This is in fact just one of many worlds where they have had to do so. They are not gods in any meaningful sense.  Nor are they particularly good their job.  Just somewhat-advanced sentients tasked with urban renewal at the planetary level. Doing the best they can.  Not quite as silly as Hitchhiker’s Guide.  But more in that vein than Game of Thrones. 

I’d like for language and playing with language to be an active part of the story-telling and a dynamic aspect of the game play. This will need to develop. Don’t want to stop the machine to work it all out ahead of time.  Interested in introducing algorithms, rules, hints/suggestions, a poetics that help to build up the language and dialects. 

Related Points
Not intending to develop character sets or full-blown phonologies at this point. That might be fun and could be quite interesting.  I did have some code at one point that did a little of this and might come back to that.  

To start out, keep it simple.  Write about the languages and dialects. Make mastery of them a useful skill like any other for a character to have.  But pay more attention to providing entertaining and descriptive names, concepts, etc. in English than trying to come up with neologisms at every turn.
Description

Bar Language Family

The major languages of the Saskan region — Eibar, Eibarq, Sogomsh, Arqa and Arqq — are all in the Bar family of languages.  Minor languages in the Bar family are:  Ahbar, Eibeerq, Sleebar


Eibar.  Eibar is the language spoken by most huum and huum-appearing residents of Saskantinon of whatever genetic mix, who live north of the River Setta and east of Kahilakol, and with the exception of Kahilabequa and Byenung, where Eibar is common but Sogomsh is more pervasive.  It is the most widely spoken language in Saskantinon.

It is the native language of the northern and western regions. As the official language of the Fatunik scribes it is the language of power in the region.  While it is not the first language of Byenung, many of the residents of that province, especially those involved in jurisprudence, are experts at it and may speak (and write) it even better than, say, a rural farmer from Rutonijal or a rancher from Jivákala. 

The standard accent of Eibar is that of the province of Eibar, one of the earliest settlements of Bar speaking huum in the region. Their pronunciation and idioms became the norm.  But as the centuries passed, Eibar itself became considerably more diverse, absorbing immigrants from Wesshewen, Ilyushan, Krbshanana and places even further away. These days, it is not unusual to hear all kinds of Eibar accents in Eibar itself, including Eibarq. 

The other Eibar-speaking areas of Saskantinon have regional accents. In most cases minor variations in sounds and a few idiomatic words. The ones that come close to full-fledged dialects are spoken in the remote hills and valleys of Eelan, the Weir Lands and Oknott.

Sleebar is a rarely heard Bar language spoken only by Sleeths.

Eibarq.  It is spoken in the easternmost areas of the Saskan Lands north of the Setta, in the provinces of Pavanarune, Kahilakol, Mobalbesq, and Byenung.  Not so much in Eibar Province, though it is more common to encounter sints there than in other Eibar-speaking provinces. 

Within these areas, players with a more distinctively non-huum-animal appearance, especially if they wish to emphasize that distinction, tend to favor the Eibarq dialect. Though Eibarq is mutually intelligible with Eibar it includes a number of phonemes rooted in other-than-huum modes of utterance. Eibarq also has a welter of alternative phrasings and words, and some grammatical constructions, that would be considered slang or incorrect in Eibar.

	Eibeerq is a dialect of Eibarq spoken by long-term sint convicts in the region of the Beet Farm.

Sogomsh.  South of the River Setta, Sogomsh rather than Eibar is the universal language.  Sogomsh and Eibar are related members of the same language family. While they are mutually intelligible to some extent, Sogomsh and Eibar are definitely distinct languages and it takes work for a speaker of one to correctly learn the other.  The distance between them would be roughly equivalent to that between Spanish and Italian in our world. 

Native Sogomsh speakers who need to interact with Heliocastronic officers or with huum who have trouble understanding Sogomsh are well-served by learning to communicate using Eibar.  It is not uncommon for Sogomsh-speakers to have some command of Eibar if they travel much or do business with huum. Having this facility helps to smooth over and avoid difficulties interacting with huum, especially with Heliops.  It is rarer for huum, especially a Fatunik True Believer (a Beshquahoen), to speak Sogomsh. It is not unheard-of though, especially not for Heliocastronic authorities or emissaries posted to Kahila lands or other non-Fatunik-majority provinces.

It is believed by some sects of First Arrivals, as they call themselves, that the earliest mix of huum and non-huum DNA emerged from within the vast Salt Marshes near the Arql Sea. It is sung that in centuries past, before the Byerunics built the Nye Lands Canal and flooded the plains, that Sogomsh was spoken throughout the Land. Whether it is truly as the First Arrivers say or not, both the Sogomsh language and the Arqa language seem to have emerged from this area and then spread across the southern Saskan Lands.

Sogomsh is the main language used in Arq province, not the eponymous Arqa language. Residents of the town of Barqton pride themselves for being the hosts of the oldest Sogomsh Language Academy and resist any attempts by others, particular those from the Runes of Bye, where the language is widely and vigorously used, to claim intellectual ownership over it. But despite those claims, most would agree that, as in so many other academic areas, the best language schools for both Sogomsh and Arqa are probably in Byenung.

The Sogomsh language plays an important role in the liturgy and legends of the entire Southern region. It is closely identified with Setta centric belief and faith systems and ritual.  A liturgical Sogomsh developed in Settarun, where it is preserved, developed and taught especially within the cultural and religious meetings centered in the town of Barbol. 

Byenung natives are taught both Arqa and Eibar along with their own mildly distinctive Byenung-inflected dialect of Sogomsh. 


Arqa and Arqq.  Just as Eibar province is the original home of Eibar, so Arq province is the birthplace of Arqa.  

Further to south, in much of the unruly Barbarana area and in some of the more remote areas of Arqa, a more growlish dialect of Arq is spoken — known as Arqq.  While some huum and very low impuros sints learn Eibarq out of sympathy for their shaped and mixed colleagues and friends, or just in order to be clearly understood in certain environments, the Arqq dialect of Arqa is in regular use many sints with a degree of impuros.  

It is especially common for those with traditional animalistic features, as opposed to those exhibiting more rare and unusual sort of non-huum features, shapings or modifications. 

Along with its additional complexities of vocabulary, Arqq’s selection of animal-centric phonemes is more difficult for huum to master as compared to than those used in Eibarq.  


Furthermore, the offices of the Heliocastronic Watches, especially the Dorq Tagabant, consider the use of Arqq little short of insurrectionist.  A huum speaking it inside the Ring in Fatunik provinces would certainly fall under suspicion, and could easily fall subject to hold in most Heliop-controlled towns and neighborhoods simply for speaking Arqq.  Being heard speaking it after sundown would most certainly get a player into hot water, possibly even marked for renewal in the next Gleaming. Even if not being actively sanctioned by the local Watch, a huum-appearing sentient speaking Arqq even during the day is likely to fall under suspicion of being a pseudo-animal by residents of those regions.

Whilst spoken most commonly far to the South , it is not unusual to hear Arqq spoken anywhere south of the Setta and even in the eastern sea-faring regions of Mobalbesq and Pavanarune.  

In Kahilabequa and Kahilakol, the use of Arqq is not common. But neither does it bring the kind of opprobrium there that it does is in other Eibar-speaking areas.  Along with the more tolerant views of the Kahila folk, there its use tends to have a distinctly political overtones as well, but in an entirely different context.  Given the proximity of the two Kahila regions to the centers of Heliocastronic authority, speaking Arqq  in the Kahila lands tends to be a way of demonstrating, particularly amongst the youth, an up-yours attitude towards the Fatunik offices and watches.  It is often admired by peers as a cool thing to do amongst youngsters trying to make a reputation for themselves amongst the romperi and bitamin outfits that make these rebellious regions their base of operations.  It is not always considered so smart by elders in those regions who'd prefer to keep a low profile.

For the same reason, the use of Arqq is popular amongst the more extremist of the self-styled animal-supremacists and animal-liberationists, even amongst those for whom it is not their native tongue, though this tends to be the case in more rural areas far from oversight from the Watch or within earshot of Sunny border guards.


Ahbar is a minor member of the Bar family spoken extensively only in a few valleys of the High Weir Lands.  It is associated with particular Empafarasi families.  Certain songs and poems emerging from these areas have achieved a high status throughout the Lands.  For this reason, Ahbar is sometimes considered to be the most beautiful or the most elevated or the most cultivated of the Bar languages.



Eaiya Language Family

Eaiya is a language family that uses pitch and tone as the primary mechanism for constructing words and concepts, with phonemes playing a secondary role. As such, the basic set of Eaiya languages are extremely different from the Bar family of tongues. To players hearing an Eaiya language for the first time, it may sound more like what we might think of as a kind of scat-jazz singing than a spoken language.   

This type of language is common in the western high mountainous region known to Bar-speakers as the Krunkinotto, among those beings who are said to have emerged from pre-catastrophic times after long hibernation underground.   Yeah, I mean the Jaxen.

Dorimea

Dorimea is an Eaiyan language common in the southern Krunkinotto, especially amongst Jaxen who have emerged, which is to say, begun to evolve, amongst the Aranzen. 


Pidgen / Syncretic Languages

Doribah

A syncretic mix of Dorimea and Ahbar, a language called Doribah does not fit neatly into other language families. It is one of several languages spoken by Aranzen people who live in the sparsely populated hilly country to the southwest of Saskantinon, south and west the southern or Low Weir Lands.   

It is not unusual to encounter travelers and traders from Aranzen in the western districts of Saskantinon.  There is regular cultural and economic exchange between Aranzen and the Saskan Weir Lands, as well as Settarun and the Terpinol Community. Aranzenners speaking/singing Doribah pop up regularly in the Settarun town of Barbol, which sits astride both the Ring and the Setta not far from the border with Aranzen.  They can also be heard in the port of Terpinol, which looks out for Saskan interests on the Aran Sea.  

Though travelers from Aranzen seldom travel inside the Ring — at least not openly — bards in both the Eibar and Sogomsh traditions like to incorporate some elements of Doribah into their songs, both for musical effect and in order to encode messages that might be difficult for listeners to detect if they are not in-the-know regarding Doribahn tonal syntax. 



Growlsh Languages

Growlsh.  Growlsh languages, which vary a good bit but have a common source, are spoken in the Krbshanana within the Krbsh Sea itself, in parts of the Forgh and southern Ilyushan, as well as in parts of the Komikol. Saying that something sounds growlish implies that it has a strong non-huum aspect to it, much stronger than saying that it is barqish, which is a milder statement.  To be barqish simply means that the speaker has an intentionally animalistic or even just an unusual accent.  To be growlish means distinctly foreign and very much impuros non-huum.

Role in Story

Northern barbarians of a "mad max" variety. But not simply a take-off on Mad Max. According to legend, the ancestral Wesshewen either refused to join the great migration to the Saskan Lands (that is the Fatunik and Rider version), or they were abandoned by the main caravan when their outrider wagons were attacked by wild beasts and vicious machines, left to fend for themselves in the wild lands (the Wesshewen version).  
Relationship to Other Organizations


Description


Roles of Members
Need to develop a few characters who "came in from the cold", attempting to integrate into Saskan society having been raised in Wesshewen. Perhaps released prisoners or some who just wanted to be more "civilized". 

Also portray the "Viking" or "German tribal" nature of the "barbarians" -- proud of their warlike heritage, fully embracing a kind of extreme liberty, seeing themselves as defenders of huum against the machines, the monsters, and wild beests, seeing the Saskantinonians as weak and decadent, not skilled as individual fighters. 

It might not be so wrong to work out a way of having the Wesshewen play a critical role in defeating the "shadows" (the Ilyushan).

            <Title>In the Garden - Scene 2</Title>
            <Synopsis>The Master of the Manifold Ways</Synopsis>
            <Text>“You scruffy old mage!”, said a very small voice in a syrupy iBerk. 

Bewitched from slurping the initial tipple of s’lah, B'arqo glanced up with a half-smile.  A delicious sip of the Full Moons’ spicy s’lah  has a fermented wallop that’s enough to sit an old dog down on his hindquarters.
The friendly Jax was gesturing in a confusing way. His mind adrift with  the initial wafts of a cinnamony buzz, B'arqo watched the gesticulations with  amusement before his attention focused the high-pitched voice saying,  “Down here, old boy. I haven’t grown an inch since we met last.  And at my age, I’m not likely to have any growth spurts.”

His head clearing, B'arqo looked down.  The proprietor stood next to the Jax, the top of the ornament adorning his cavalier hat just barely reaching above the Jax’s knees. How a diminutive gecko sint had come to manage the most notorious Inn in the most infamous part of the Ríkila bazaar was an enduring mystery to many.  Not to B'arqo, who knew a great many things.  But to many other folks it was an enduring mystery. 
Emerging from the s’lah induced wave of nostalgia, B'arqo considered that he might know too many things for his own good.  Then he considered just the opposite. 
Neither thought helped to explain how he’d managed to forget the diminutive size of Master Kirill Geckter-of-the-Manifold Ways, proprietor of the Full Moons, prominent member of the Free Innkeepers community, and - some folks say - a prime mover of recently acquired goods.  

Ever the coarsely ground diplomat of song, B'arqo greeted his old pal with, “So. Still crawling through the cracks of the system, you fookin romperi scoundrel?  Or have you seen the light? Tell me brother-sister, that you’re ready to embrace the Sacred Fire and I will fetch the Dorq Tagabant. Let’s let them know you’re ready to submit. Yes-good?”

The proprietor’s huum features were distinctly impuros in a gecko direction, particularly his head. Considerably elongated, it melded into the torso in a way that would be extremely unusual for a puros.  The skin had a distinctly greenish and slightly scaly quality as well.  
He was very tiny.
Furthermore, the Master of the Full Moons chose to accentuate and celebrate his-her appearance with various fashion accessories:  along with the exotic hat, the swashbuckler get-up featured an over-sized and brightly-colored cape and boots, a bandolier tool-belt holding tiny knives and other contraptions.  Kirill carried a, relatively speaking, large stick whose knobby jeweled end emitted a slightly shimmery blue aura. Whacking the Jax’s hip with his glow-stick, which clearly gave them a jolt, Kirill signaled the Lookie that the boss was to be raised up to the level of B'arqo’s nose. 

The free Jax squatted, then carefully lifted Kirill so that the Master of the Manifold Ways could stand on the clone’s thigh.
“Master Kirill, thank you for making time for me,” B'arqo whispered, switching to the Eibeerq dialect common to sint convicts who’ve spent a  number of turns in the Beet,  “I have serious tidings. Is there a place we can confer in private?”
“Let’s go,”  said Kirill. He-she yelled into the ear of Jax: “Take us to the garden!”. Then gently whacked the clone on the head with the glowy little stick.</Text>

            <Text>This was a later, shorter summary of Act II

===========

Henk and Iohane have perished. The attempted rescue failed to save their lives. But it sparked a revolt throughout the Lands that threatens to upset the Fatunik hegemony and possibly re-ignite the old animosities between westerners and easterners. 

It opens the door to the re-formation of Fatunik argument along Mobalbesquan lines. 

The rescue attempt and ensuing uprising were foreshadowed by the Event in Ríkila, which we learn about in more detail through dialog and flashbacks. Also this cleverly sets the stage for me to write another book about the before-times....

The following sections introduce characters involved in or affected by the rescue and ensuing uprisings.

In poetic terms, introduce words evocative of rising as that will be the ongoing theme of Act Two. Some kind of lady in the lake metaphor would be appropriate, continuing the pool metaphors.

Use the mythos of the dark pond, dark lake, cenote — the ancient secret of Beshquohuk — as a central motif-making factory.

            <Title>Harmonies - Scene 1</Title>
            <Text>A cadre of Fatunik Specials wore disguises as buyers of raw materials for the Brothers of Pure Fear, a widely-known weapons manufacturing guild out of Rutónik.  
They strolled around Eelan Toon trying to be nonchalant as they asked random townsfolk for directions to where the Dance would be held and inquired as to who might be performing this turn. Their disguises failed to fool the Eelani locals.  Quickly detected by numerous Eelani Sunspotters, both amateur and professional, who’d been doing business with folks from the central provinces for generations. They could spot a phony from a hundred leaps.  
Despite the good business brought by their Holistic neighbors, the Eelani were a reserved people holding deep historical grudges towards the Sun worshippers.  
Beyond a few friendly nods in the direction of the Path out of town towards the Weir Lands, and even more not-so-friendly nods in various random directions, no Eelan Toon residents were forthcoming.

The counter-espionage Sunspotters Network of Eelan acted like a central nervous system for the eastern hill country.  Without any orders, acting on instincts as old as the hills themselves, Eelani freeriders were soon sharing far and wide, throughout the western hill country, bemused stories about the newly arrived Fatunik spies.
At mines, freeholds, farms and artisan manufactories throughout the region, the word spread like a spring breeze. 
Among those hearing the news were the comrades of the Old Mill Cooperative on the Upper Pavan, upstream from Mabhkahol on the Eelan side of the river. The Mill had ceased operations for the season once preparations were completed for the annual Feast of the Full Moons.  
Folks meeting at the mill were a mixed group of Co-op members and others from the area who’d volunteered for provisioning a variety of vendors setting up during preparations for the dance, and for those handling the great feast that would follow.  Preparing for the Dance was a major entertainment for the hill folk. 
Among their number at the Mill was one who, unbeknownst to the rest, reported back to a Circle of Fives known as the Clockwise Sixth, code-named for obscure bio-musicological reasons as The Bees. 
Six other members of the Bee cohort rendezvoused further upstream. Making their way to Eelan Toon along the path from the Upper Weir Lands, the Bees mixed in with growing crowds traveling to the festival from the hill towns and villages around High Weir, sharing the buzz of excitement generated by the impending festivities.

Azron Gurk traveled on the path from the Weir Highlands too. Setting out once again on an obscure mission from the Agency, he liked to joke, quietly, and typically only to himself, that it was a  “Mission Inscrutable”.  
The old man joined a sizable group of festival-goers camped together for safety during the evening. They were still nearly a day’s walk to the site of the Dance.  Azron stifled a yawn while wandering from camp-fire to camp-fire, dutifully persisting in information-gathering efforts amongst groups of the tight-lipped hill people. They were seldom willing to share anything of interest. And were jolly good at not revealing not much at all about anything, Azron thought with an internal sigh. 
He wondered if he’d ever have an interesting conversation again, or if he was going to be stuck among these country rubes forever.  

The Eelani and weiring hill people did take exceeding delight in teaching the old man with the odd accent about the sacred importance of the river-fish-on-a-stick. 
Once they deigned to speak, they never tired of babbling ad nauseam in their sing-songs accents about their favorite Holy Hills too.  Azron’d heard it all before, dozens of times, no, hundreds of times, over multiple generations. 
It was an old hill country prank. Having heard many of the same droll stories from the great-great-grands of these festival-goers, he was bored to the point of tears. Still. A job’s a job. The Agency would want to hear all the dull details. Again.
Pulling on something resembling a happy face, Azron greeted another group of campers with a hearty version of the standard local greeting:  “Hello fellows, well met! Do you have a song today?” 
Which in the local vernacular was understood to mean “Could you spare a splash of s’lah?”, of which there was plenty to go around and Azron was  satisfyingly soused soon enough. 

The Bees had been notified, through their liaison to another Clockwise Fifth cell referred to as the Sharpies that a person sent from the Agency would probably show up at some point en route.  
Azron’s description was known to them.  Once arriving at the camp-site they picked up on Azron in short order. 
Carefully, one by one, they casually made their way towards him, wandering about in a fashion mimicking his own.  As instructed, they greeted him with shy smiles and the odd remark, “Hey fellow! Have you heard a new song clearly today?”  
Azron knew something was up with these strangers.  But even Old Gurdon of the Lost Planet, as his boss had mockingly referred to him at the last staff meeting, couldn’t quite place it exactly.  
They seemed quite familiar with local customs, yet they carried themselves distinctly from regular hill people. And seemed to be doing so purposefully. Like they wanted to be noticed by anyone who was really looking for them.  
They moved too much like weirlings to be Heliopsic Specials. Were way too loose and easy in their manner to be Riders.  And didn’t act like southerners trying to “Be More weirie”, as southern kids liked to say, either.  And that odd remark they made in greeting, “have you heard a new song clearly”, not only was not a typical hill country phrase but seemed very much a wink-wink-nudge-nudge sort of acknowledgment regarding his former trade in his former… umm…lands.  
They seemed to be feeling him out in some subtle way, perhaps studying him for a response.

Intrigued and hoping buy a bit of time in order to study them in return, Azon tried a trick of the trade that sometimes helped to create a psycho-physical space in which he could observe folks more closely.  
The next time it happened, he heartily laughed at their odd remark, then asked his new acquaintances if they’d like to learn a game from his native region.  When they turned to his notice, he claimed to be from a remote fishing village just off the coast of the Isle of Nye Lands.  The agent — or whatever it was — quickly agreed to the game.  The cohort gathered near him, along with others intrigued by his performance.

Azron announced, with a dramatically disdainful tone and loudly enough so that other folks near them in the camp could hear, that in his opinion his game was ten times more interesting than discussing the ridiculous mystical properties of a fish-on-a-stick.  And eight times more fruitful than a walk up any so-called holy hills.  
The local sing-song and hub-bub quieted down as a small crowd drew near.  The hill folk could see he knew their pranks.  They wandered closer to see if, as the saying went, perhaps the old man had “an auspicious ninth” — their colloquial way of saying “a clever retort”. 

If only they knew where my home village really was, the intergalactic traveler thought, as he  placed a drinking cup on a nearby stump and explained to the audience that the game was called “silently-stare-at-the-mug-until-you-blink”.  In a serious deadpan tone, Azron explained that this was a favorite pastime of the Nye Lands fisherfolk and that doing it right brought interesting rewards.  
Dramatically pulling a pair of seeing-spectacles from his over-sized coat and placing them on his nose, Azron proceeded to stare intently at the drinking mug, the spectacles dramatically enlarging his eyeballs to the on-lookers.  Humming an old Nye Lands ballad about the folly of falling in love with a laNye Landsr from Byenung Toon, and seeming to be looking for something in one of the large pockets of his oversized overcoat, Azron subtly adjusted their setting to scan the crowd for implants, machinic prosthetics, or other out-of-place weaponry.


The supposed business delegation from Rutónik took a room at the Inn of the Great Resistance near Eelan Toon’s southern gate. They pretended to admire the ancient murals adorning the walls of the common room depicting the events of the First Great Terror.  They remembered to keep their opinions about The Great Wall of Fire to themselves, though one of them almost laughed out loud as a snarky remark occurred to him. 
The crafting of the murals was exquisite, the paintings kept fresh and adorned with emphatic embellishments done in the Eelan style, using shiny metals and stone-stuff to elaborate the motifs.  
Once gathered in their room, with the door carefully closed, the thoroughly disgusted lead Tagabant spoke. As one who’d mastered Western styles and accents more thoroughly than the others, had plenty of experience with the Dorq Tagabant, and might even be able to pass for a Sallofolian Loyalist who’d migrated to Qurol or Sungyte, he contested, with the firmness and determination of one aspiring to become an Elder of the Supreme Council of Beshquohuk, as to the quality of their training and their lack of results so far in information-gathering.  
He berated them in the way that a “Father of the Real People” was expected to:  “You fools, idiots and weaklings!  Have you been staring at the stars?  For Sun’s sake, find your fire!  We know the Western Witch will be here. Be alert! Our job is to find it and subdue it and break up it’s network.  Do not fail in your duties to the Eternal Flame!”

The others bowed deeply in acknowledgment of the leader’s Authority, committing themselves to the stated Correction.  After completing ritual abasements, they made their way back to the Common Room for an evening meal and to mix with the locals.  None of them had ever tasted the western delicacy known as chillah, a stacked bunch of thin fried maize-cakes, layered between various types of local plant-food, dripping with the melted churned cheese of the Eelan mountain goat, and flavored with local chilis and herbs.  
They tried, somewhat ridiculously, to balance their new-found delight with the delicious Eelani cuisine and their desire to not appear as foreigners, with their desire to not appear like foolish gluttons under the watchful eyes of the Leader.  
A difficult balancing act. 
Later that night, the youngest of them, who was just fresh out of Tagabant Training and had been sent with the Watch due to exhiaybeting cleverness in languages, whispered appreciation to a bed-mate for the Eelani cuisine.  This earned a shushing, as well as a secreted hand grip of agreement.  They muffled their giggles, hid their smiles and continued to hold hands long after the Leader announced, “Quiet!” 

The Sun began to set. The Moons of Lurabar rose in their double-glory, almost at twin full.  Signaling the start of the festival days, early arrivals from the Lower Weir Lands and Western Settany, dressed in colorful robes and capes and fanciful costumes, paraded onto the performance grounds.  
Southern dancers flowed to an area of trees forming the backdrop where the Great Dance would be held the next evening. They broke into a ritual of chanting and twirling  meant to bring happiness to the tree-spirits living there.  The dance and the chants thanked the tree-sints for allowing the multitudes who were about to descend for the use of this space. And they promised to take good care of the area. 
Eager scribes and bards. mostly from the southwestern lands, had also arrived. They were busy sketching depictions or developing new lyrics describing the details of this year’s festivities to bring back to their communities. 
A pack of translucent, nearly-invisible white wolves had traveled for many days down from the Krunkinotto in the hopes of disrupting this event with a gory feed. Hungry and ready for a good slaughter, they licked their chops anticipating the glory of taking trophies back to their masters.  
Lurking in the woods, they were suddenly spooked when the tree-spirits, awakened from their year-long hibernation by the revelers, detected the bad dogs. In their whispering windy way that no dog could ignore, they ordered the wolves, in no uncertain terms, to flee back to their masters if they didn’t want to suffer a barrage of broken limbs.

Jonn Jariqol was from a small village between Barbol and Terpinol, not too far from the Aran Sea.  Born with a bit of coyote and also trained, as  occultation teachers from the village liked to put it, in “detecting unsung notes”.   
Smiling as the wind whipped up Jonn noticed something of the unfolding drama between the tree-sints and the nether-wolves more clearly than most others did.  Whispering to a dance-mate as they twirled past on another, Jonn shared that “One day I’d like t’kill them wicked wolves once ‘n for-all.”

17 • Low Weir/Freedom

Role in Story
With a strong southern perspective, she reveals life and thought in the south lands while bringing a fresh perspective into the Fatunik Lands.   Allane's mother?

Goal
To learn. To grow. To promote the influence of Malavorra and the River-Soul worldview.

Physical Description
Wild hair. Big everything. Female presentation.

Personality
Big

Occupation
Visitors guide. Occasional farm hand

Habits/Mannerisms
Enjoys telling the stories and singing the songs of Malavorra, Low Weir and the River-Soul. 

Background
Raised by an Dauni Vakasaqua family in the southern Weir Lands.

Internal Conflicts
As much as she likes Low Weir and her job, Zadane is intensely curious about the other provinces. She resents somewhat being kept down on the farm. Likes to wander about the Weir Lands, has also made occasional trips to Eelan and the Settanarune. Has never been to the Fatunik provinces.

External Conflicts
Near the end of the tale, she gives us an angle into another story...

She stumbles upon a cave entrance that leads to an underground facility beneath Low Weir. Astonished to learn that the elders keep secrets from the collective. And that the nature of those secrets -- genetic engineering, weapons, flight-related technology -- may contradict widely-propagated Dauni Vakasaqua and Settan pacifistic views.

+ / -  Main conflicts in this scene.

Bu'ruq, Mu'ray and Monmar Massachawa sneak into Juuj, where they encounter sint communities  in the underground caverns and waterways way beneath the Deep Pool, as well as huge marine worms who may or may not be sentient.

They set off a tremor that sends ripples upwards to the Deep Pool of Juuj.

&gt; &lt;  Main events, resolutions, actions in this scene.

MM's team locate Quinn and let him know they are there. She offers him an escape plan but he chooses not to escape with them because he wants to present his Argument to the Elders.  She impresses SPQ with her rebel spirit, and she with his, sparking a kind of empathetic emotional electrical storm.  Think of the whale-phoenix dyad gathering its strength in the first story of Zhuangzi, preparing to explore the vast otherness of the universe.  

The Elders are the doves, the pigeons, the guppies, the trout darting about, satisfied with their knowledge of things, dismissive of the vastness they cannot comprehend.

The Elders read the disturbance as an omen. But of what? They are not sure.

Timeline

Action --&gt; Following directly from chapter 6. While the respectable folks in the Outer Lands are preparing for war and legal battles, MM and her gang are taking direct action.
Beauty

The Deep Pool lies at the center of large cenote, where the Elders gather at its periphery as the Sun reflects on its surface. Their song is one of whispers.

Many creatures live underground and raise their kids there, often having built cozy alcove-like bed clusters around a play space with curtains (not doors) separating it from a common space. We'll see this pattern reproduced in the Fatunik-style Brood Houses, providing a visual tie between the species' experiences after the Catastrophe.
Humor

MM treats the "great and terrible Oz" Elders like a child's toy. No respect. 
Truth

The pelvis is the second-largest body mass after the ribcage. 
Impact

Cool, we've learned multiple emergency climbing techniques: chimneying, manteling, stemming, a heel hook, crimper holds and pincher holds.

            <Text>Oknott
West of the Ring, north of Eelan, east of the southern Krunkinotto

Role in Story
The Land of Men.  Key hinterland of the loyal Rider countryside. A prosperous province, Oknottr refines and manufactures many desirable goods supplying both Borded and Qurol.  The region is also exposed to new thinking of the Weir Lands. As the epic unfolds, the Rider faction who break away are centered in Oknott.

While the land is called Oknott, the people who live and work there are called the Bordali, possibly in reference to a more ancient name for these rugged lands.

Ethics. Sacrifice. 
Related Characters
Main towns are:

 Mabhakol. Very high tower, well-fortified. Lots of manufacturing of all types. Built next to an active and deep mine. Overlooks the Northern River just before it flows under the Ring. 

Borded, the great Rider capital, sits on the Ring just on the other side of the River, both of which make up borders to this province. While formally it sits astride 2 other provinces, Borded is the undoubted metropolitan capital of Oknott.
Season
I think of Oknott as often a bit dark and gloomy in its mid-section, more like Eelan and the Weir Lands to the south, and a kind of arid plain to the north, but increasingly well-irrigated the closer one gets to the river. 

Unique Features
A very large peak defines its western border with the Krunkinotto range.
A large military encampment just over the border with Liganalupán, north of the river. 
Description
In many ways the Rider’s “homeland”.  Many ring riders and others who work directly for the council in Borded hail from this region.

            <Text>Iyaghold


Type of Location

The only fortified military encampment in the Kahila Lands, the fortress of Iyaghold guards the northern border of Kahilabequa from the central Fatunik province to Tabloonque.

Role in Story

Near the conclusion of the Kahila Wars, the Fatunika occupied a strip of land connecting the two Kahila provinces, between Juukal and the Rune of Bye, incorporating the Kahila Strip in Juukal.

This remains a sore point of contention between the Kahilafolk and the Authority.

The strip is guarded by a sizable Fatunik encampment at the western end of the strip, actually located just over the border in Tabloonque. The establishment of this permanent camp, seen as a symbol of occupation, was particularly galling to the Kahilabequan elements who had sought a just and peaceable accomodation to end the hostilities. Their response when the Helipticon refused to remove their camp was the establishment of the Iyaghold.

            <Title>Mikel Moballeq</Title>
            <Text>Mikel Moballeq
70s or 80s • Location

Role in Story
Descendent of the original settlers of Mobalbesq, elder of the Mobal Beshqi, Mikel Moballeq is happy to provide a perspective on Fatunik authority from an indigenous mostly-beklek tribe who have developed their own autonomous understanding of Catastrophic ideology.  

He offers a path to a cosmopolitan world view within the mix of eastern Saskan thinking and tradition. 

The King. The Prince. A Wise Father.

Need some equivalent characters for other key regions, etc.… 

		Who is actually part of the Authority?
		Who leads the Riders Council?
		Who is the head of the Empafarasi? 
		Who are the Elders of the Eelani?
		Who are the heads of the bitamin and romperi clans?
		Who are the heads of the main Guilds?
		…
Goal
We might think of Mikel M as someone who presents a Shi’a-like take as an alternative to the Sunni-like orthodoxy of the Authority. Or a Mahayana riff far afield from the core Fatunik Theravada old school vehicle, while still remaining true to the main themes of the tradition. 

Physical Description
Wounded, troubled, but still standing. Mikel, like the Mobal Beshqi clan in general, endures.

Personality
Loquaicious, well-versed in Fatunik theology and terminology.  Has ability and willingness to be syncretic and to be open to cosmopolitan views that endears him to many southerners.  

Occupation
Effectively the governor of the province of Mobalbesq, though such titles do not officially exist.  Jefe of a large estate in the Mobalbesq, involved in numerous enterprises. Has close connections to the Fatunik authorities. Also on good terms with Riders, various southern guilds and tribes, sea-borne connections of various types, the Byenung complex of organizations and families, connections with influential parties in the Nye Lands, and, via Ríkila, even to certain Kahila tribes and organizations. 

He is definitely the person you want to know if you want to get things done in Mobalbesq.

Habits/Mannerisms
Bisexual. Vegetarian. Has had many partners and admirers. As a person high up in the hierarchy, is free by Fatunik norms to openly express a male gender, which he does, but in an over-bearing way only on rare occasions when he needs to throw his considerable weight around, particularly with Fatunik characters. 

Background
Many stories and songs about his origins.  Maybe Mikel was born in faraway Shanowa and came to the Saskan Lands as a teen-ager.  He refuses to discuss his early childhood. Maybe he was captured and mistreated by Kahila rebels for being the heir-apparent in a strong Fatunik-sympathizing Mobal Beshqi tribe.  

His family was instrumental in the development of the Beshquan Turn in Fatunik orthodoxy, which led to the declaration of the Bishopric centered in Beshquohuk, which took power away from the High Council in Eibar.  Nevertheless, their local version of Fatunik theology differs considerably from the `reformed` orthodoxy of the modern Center. 

Internal Conflicts
His multiple love affairs and relationships make his personal life complicated.  Some of his great loves were tragic, losing partners to battles or disease.  In other cases, they were strange and hard to fathom. His encounters with representatives from the Agency, who seemed to appear and disappear like the wind, marked several of his most memorable relationships.

In other cases, he was romantically attracted to other men who didn’t necessarily feel so strongly, suffering from unrequited love. In some case they didn’t have a desire for a same-sex relationship at all.

His multiple off-spring from multiple relationships put the lie to his avowed Fatunikism, as several of them exhibit obviously mixten phenotypes.   There is an expectation that his role as something like sheik of all the Mobal Beshqi would pass to one of his kids via a fair selection process. But he is leery of visiting this heavy responsibility on his kin.

External Conflicts
Has some serious conflicts going on with less-savory bitamin and romperi groups centered in the Kahilakol.  One of his offspring has been missing for some time. He suspects that Xavi has been abducted by the bandits, but isn’t sure. Fundamentalist forces are developing in the central woods around Stanbuk. They are preparing Arguments declaring that the Mobal Beshqi form of Sun-worship is heretical.  This is completely wrapped-up-in and inter-related with the trials being endured by Stanley Phoenix Quinn, who is a kind of adopted second cousin to Mikel Moballeq.

Notes
Although he is a wealthy and influential and respectable personage, Mikel was a member of revolutionary Mobal Beshqi sect as a youth.  This is why he never talks about that period of his life.  Still has fond feelings for alternative approaches to Tomorrow.

Probably need to show a family tree. And outline in more detail the background of the Fatunik internal conflicts and schisms.

Mikel Moballeq is unexpectedly  handed a foster child.  He discovers that he is the lucky one.

Disagreements triggered by Stan's Argument and Bud Starga's intervention erupt amongst the Agents assigned to Gavor.


&gt; &lt;  Main events, resolutions, actions in this scene.

Pre-adolescent Stanley is brought north out of Arq by B'arqo, who rescued him from abandonment to a brothel there.

 Teen-aged Showan accompanies a crew making an official Byenung diplomatic visit to the Mobalbesq communes on behalf of a Night Hall initiative. He meets SPQ when the delegation arrives at the Moballeq estate. Is intrigued and startled by Stanley's work with kites.

Young adult Showan repeatedly visits the Moballeq commune to learn what Stanley is working on, bringing him some materials, and forging a bit more than a friendship.  SPQ, though introverted, is more comfortable with sex than Showan is. Showan is supposed to be saving himself for something resembling a "royal" match with another influential Byenung family.  There is a stolen kiss at one point, a dance, a first embrace.

Young adult Showan and SPQ take a trip around the Ring together, aimed at gathering agricultural info from the various regions. This trip deepens their bond and they swear fealty to one another at one point but fall short of declaring a bond. We see Iohane and Henqu in their prime and experience the full, umm, Ring Cycle of songs and sounds. Both are bowled over by a Birakay performance in Qurol. Birakay flirts with both of them, which disrupts their relationship. 

Ramona was adopted along with Stanley. Xavi is Mikel's natural son; his mother is Monmar Massachawa. 

Agency Vice Regent Bud Starga lets the Agents know he intends to intervene against SPQ's Argument out of fear that it will lead to uncovering the true nature of the Enclosure. 

Foreshadowing/mystery: As a side-note during the grand tour -- an alarm is triggered in a Sleeth village. (Wtf? What is it? Is that is the past or in the current/argument-in-Beshquohuk story arc timeline? Maybe it is an actual rumble, a small earthquake. The Jaxen are tunneling...)

An alternative to consider... Introduce Ramona as Stanley's adoptive sister. Or maybe she came with him from Arq and may or may not be his biological sister.  Like Stan, she is wicked smart, intensely interested in reducing suffering, understanding the nature of things, but with more of an emphasis on understanding the old stories, mythologies, creation tales and so on. Make it clear that she and Stan are indigenous people, not a part of the huum migration that settled the Saskan Lands, that they are from tribes even older than the Mobalbesqi or Kahila claims. Her work is to gather these tales and songs, which creates a bond of interest between her and Birakay. Her beauty and intelligence also attracts Showan to her. She becomes Showan's accomplice in his efforts to ensure SPQ's safety and promote his cause. And there is a complicated emotional entanglement amongst the 4 of them. We may end up with Showan and Ramona partnering even tho Showan  continues to carry a torch for Stanley (which may be Platonic?).

We get the link between the two MM's. 

Finish - Trouble boils over on the ASS Visitor as other Agents voice their disagreements with the Vice Regent's proposed intervention.

            <Title>Lurabar</Title>
            <Text>(All of this needs a bit more mapping.)

Lurabar names the continent that hosts the Enclosure. It includes some continents and some very large islands. Beyond it is The Edge of the World. The name Lurabar refers to fact that all its land is surrounded by the world-ocean. Lurabar is used in the sense of the world as well as of the ocean.

Though in fact, there is more to Gavor (the planet) than Lurabar.
Nor is all of Lurabar inside the Enclosure.  

There is a widely-held belief that the lands and lives of Saskantinon and bordering areas  have been enclosed, in some physical sense, by a higher power or powers.  Sun-worshippers center this belief in a power residing in the Sun, while so-called Moons-worshippers center their beliefs in powers residing away from the Sun, such as in the Full Moons, in the Wanderers (planets), in various configurations of Stars, or in the Beyond. 

A smaller set of believers state that life and existence is itself literally an illusion in the sense that some greater power has imagined, dreamed or somehow caused to come into self-consciousness the lands and beings of Lurabar, or at least those within the Enclosure, which is seen as a kind of dream chamber. 

A variation on that belief is a materialist version which considers that the lands and lives of Enclosed Lurabar are some kind of experiment being conducted by unknown outside forces.  

The last belief is closest to fact. The planet (called Gavor by those who understand that there is a planet) experienced a bad case of the Catastrophicals and nearly wrecked itself. As in so many other cases, the Agency came along and do some engineering to rehabilitate the place. These manually implemented evolutionary tweaks, initiated thousands of years ago, were intended to help prevent the worst outbreaks of catastrophe from happening again.  The effects of strong constraints in place are seen in limitations on / taboos against burning fossil fuels, on letting inter-species imbalances go too far, as well as suspicions regarding rapid transit and long-range communications, and on over-population. 

Dangerous imbalances in speciation, like very few flying things and a dearth of pollinators, as well as some mutations and variations that were not designed so much as allowed to proceed, highlight the errors or unintended consequences of these interventions. 


Lurabar contains several large land masses. Our story takes place (for now) only on the northern land mass referred to as Lurabar.  For most of the characters in our story, little is known of the lands of Lurabar outside of the Saskantinon, and virtually nothing of the lands beyond the sea.

There are two islands of considerable size — they could even be considered small continents —  to the east of Lurabar. The first is Pentacross and the second Greenstrand. North of Pentacross is the cold and icy island of Bir, the northernmost land. To the west of Lurabar are a group of four islands, plus three more small islands much further west, actually closer to Mudhook than to the other islands in this group.  While three of these islands are quite sizable, none are anywhere near as large as those to the East. They are called, collectively, The Firelands.  

The largest land mass in the world lies to the south of Lurabar; it is called Bricot.  South of Bricot lies the southernmost land of Lurabar, a nearly uninhabited land frozen in ice.  Some legends say that the frozen land of Rikondo passes beyond the Enclosure, that is, beyond the Edge of the World, but none of whom we know have ever traveled there and back again.  A sizable island to the west of Bricot is called Mudhook. Two smaller islands to the east of Bricot’s thinning peninsular eastern extension, well to south of Pentacross and Greenstrand, are called, collectively, Asterlorn. 


Between Lurabar’s Krbshanana Peninsula, Bricot northeastern shore, and to the southwest of Pentacross lie a collection of islands, some a bit larger, some quite small, scattered over hundreds of klicks of ocean. These, along with several of the extruberances along the southern cost of the Forgh (southeastern Luramar), and an island just off the eastern coast of Luramar, bordering the Realms of the Shanowa, are referred to collectively as The Remari, which can be loosely translated as “holes in the ocean”.  Some parts of our story take place there.

Card Number: 25
+ / -  Main conflicts in this scene.

Tonedo spews final argument rebutting SPQ, who defends himself.
Birakay's New Song (kata?) spreads through the Lands like wild fire.
Birakay, now widely hailed as the Dragon Immortal appears in Beshquohuk, joining the calls for SPQ's vindication and release.

&gt; &lt;  Main events, resolutions, actions in this scene.

This is another "big radio" chapter, but with more song and dance and back-and-forth. Keep the "masses" (the crowd, the chorus, the jesters) involved as before.

Showan speaks in defense of SPQ, on behalf of the Byenung.
Representatives from Mobalbesq and the Nye Lands indicate their support for Showan's points.
Representatives from several Fatunik regions denounce Stanley, bringing up the case of Allane and the slain candle-maker to highlight the dangers posed by dissenters.
The old official Representative from Borded urges calm and highlights the greater danger posed by the Ilyushan, calling for a kind of cease-fire until that threat is addressed.  
Waleran interrupts the Borded Representative, and introduces Otto Trucent as the newly elected rep from the Riders Council. Otto announces that the Riders, the Eelani and the Empafarasi all support Stanley's Argument.

Tonedo's rebuttal includes at least the following points:
	•	Losing traditional songs and good old ways of practicing movement will be the price for adopting new ways.
	•	If the Enclosure / Fatunik leadership falls, it could bring new dangers, possibly another catastrophe. We could all get burned again.
	•	Claims that the westerners are trying to re-ignite the old civil war, are effectively doing the bidding of Kahila criminals, and have been morally corrupted by southern thinking.
	•	Birakay is obviously decadent and heretical and should be held for the Decision of the Gleaming.

Birakay interrupts from the gallery, singing...
	•	Denounces the persecution of Allane
	•	Denounces the execution of Iohane and Allane
	•	Praises the arguments of Showan and Stanley

Stanley's defense includes s at least the following points:
	•	Adopting new ways and new thinking is the only way to survive. It doesn't mean all old ways have to be abandoned. There can be harmony.  The people of the Lands can work together to fight invasion as well as to save themselves from starvation.
	•	If the Enclosure / Fatunik leadership falls, it could bring new opportunities, possibly a golden age. We could eliminate affliction and heal ancient divisions. We also don't need outside agents guiding us (directed to Bud Starga) -- gasps as people grasp the implications of his accusations.  
	•	Birakay is obviously beautiful and inspirational and I love him. (Showan is hurt. Ramona holds his hand.) Stanley adopts the stance of the dragon and performs the new kata. Birakay dramatically leaps from the gallery to be by his side.

Tonedo orders both Stan and Birakay arrested and imprisoned.  As the guards attempt to seize them, the crowd in the temple erupts into disorder, which spills into the streets, where something like a full-blown insurrection develops, with MM and crew leading the charge,  echoing the Event in Ríkila. 

Finish --&gt;  A double-exposure of Bud Starga trying to explain himself to other Agents, who are appalled at his interventions. And Tonedo trying to explain himself to the Elders of Juuj, who are appalled at his failures. (See notes on Humor below)

(Note: the "troubles" after the Gleaming should be more on the order of a peaceful protest that is brutally suppressed. )

Timeline

Action --&gt; Continuing directly from chapter 19.
Beauty  

Brain and brawn unite. Sky and Earth flow together.  Jing is transformed into Qi, rising to illuminate Shen. The transformation is both physical and metaphysical.
Humor

First time tragedy, second time farce. This is an echo of chapter 10, where Iohane and Henqu were denounced by Tonedo and it was a solemn, tragic moment. This time it is a farcical show and the birth of a dizzying plethora of alternatives. See pp. 142-143 of Zizek's Jokes, the ones in the Afterword about his father coming up with excuses for letting his plant wither. Use that to make fun of Tonedo and Bud Starga.
Truth

This unspeaking, worn-out despair must come to an end. How do those who dwell in dehumanization live with themselves?
Impact

Like cheering for the underdog hero of a kung fu movie.

Role in Story
Despite the "Free" in its title, the FHC is the financial cornerstone of the Riders Union. Along with being a lucrative business, innkeeping also provides the Riders Council with a network of listening posts throughout the Saskan Lands.

Whereas the Free Innkeepers are largely independent proprietors who manage their businesses through a variety of connections, the FHC inns, stables and hostels are like a "brand", all offering a similar level of services and using the Rider network for their supplies and planning.

The larger inns and hostels run by the FHC are often indistinguishable from something like a Riders Embassy in the Toons and Villages where they are located.

            <Text>Eelan Toon
West of the Ring, south of Oknott, east of The Weir Lands

Role in Story
Eelan is the name both of a province within the Borded Federation and the main town in the province.

Provide some sense of the older inhabitants of the region, who are neither Fatunik, nor devotees of the southern beliefs, nor Kahila, nor part of the new/high/hidden thinking found in places like the Empafarasi Weir Lands and parts of the Outer Lands. 

The mines and hills of Eelan to provide the material foundation of the musical character of the region, and the character of its people.  These are country/hill people, hard working miners, not easily impressed, determinedly fond of their folkways which tend towards an affinity for the Finders.

Duty. Tradition
Related Characters


Season


Unique Features
Only one well-kept road through the region, it directly connects Eelan to Bordakol in the Borda Woods and through a much more circuitous route to Mabhakol in Oknott. A smaller, more difficult road connects Eelan to Qurol, just inside the Ring and on the Northern River.  These are mainly commercial connections. Eelaners seldom leave the region.

Description
The region is loosely allied to the Riders Council. It is the most autonomous of the four members of the Federation. In some matters, the Eelani do business directly with the Heliops rather than through Borded.  The folk-religion involves a strong interest in ancient artifacts, but without any hidden meaning, just a kind of ecstatic belief in redemption-from-toil and talismans against re-emergence of catastrophe. Americans might read it as a kind of Baptist faith, de-centralized, congregational, anti-hierarchical. Has some aspects of saint/guru practice also in the manner of Sufis, Sikhs and some Hindus.

Sights
Eelan is the main town in the province of Eelan. Several large mining operations in the region.  Many mining roads throughout the region.

Sounds
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho.  Work, work, work. The region will remind some readers of a kingdom of the dwarves.
Smelting, hammering, carts rolling. Lots of singing to go with it. 
Smell

            <Title>Stanley Phoenix Quinn</Title>
            <Text>Stanley Phoenix Quinn
Early 20’s • Mobalbesq

Role in Story
The main character. Our somewhat understated hero.
 
Evocative of Kim Stanley Robinson and R. Buckminster Fuller. With some personality of my gaming SPQ character(s): a verbose, slightly salty intellectual with radical views. 
See log-line. A sexy but shy socialist scientist. 

"Socialist" meaning: a person raised in the free spirit of inquiry characteristic of the Mobalbesq,  more so than Byenung. More like Maury Bookchin-esque social ecologist than anything else.  Free-syndicalist. Free-wheeling savant. 

For the Byenung connection, see Showan Biver-Wing.

Provide insight into life in Mobalbesq, the role of Mobalbesq committees and culture in shaping the destiny of the Lands. 
Bring a technical angle into the plot lines, regarding flight in particular.

The redemptor. The new god. A rebel. A free bird.

Refer to him as Stanley or Stan.  Rebirth… flight angle. SPQ. Hints at future empire…
Stanley Phoenix Quinn, Regent …

Don't make him TOO boring! He is our hero. He needs to come across as an adventurer and a rebel as well as something of an anarchist "immortal" attuned to the vastness of the Dao, a seer.  

He is not anti-establishment due to class consciousness so much as an understanding of the nature of things more generally. He knows the Heliop and Rider Co-Authority will decay. He knows that the huum cannot survive without the sint.  He has seen the Enclosure, and seen beyond it. 

Let him get into meditative states. "Freezing". Standing still as a tree. Sitting like a rock. During which he travels far, both internally and externally.

Goal
- Pose the main problems in the story…
   - So what is the real existential threat to the Lands? What game is really being played?
   - What really needs to be done to save lives, reduce suffering?
   - How is nationalist fear-based ideology combatted?
   - How to save the lands from famine and starvation?
- Connect the Jaxen/Created sub-plot to the main storyline in a complex, interdependent manner, not simply as the evil other. Pose the problematic of advanced AI/ML with some degree of depth and seriousness.

Physical Description
Presents male. Looks and acts older than actual age.   
Has highly developed mental and empathic capacities, bordering on the telepathic which have allowed him to learn many things quickly at a young age.  
Has raven and bluejay DNA in his mix, giving him a striking look. Having avian DNA puts him in connection with lost/re-discovered strains of life. 
Shockingly black hair is sleek but unruly.
Prefers the somewhat formal attire popular in the Mobalbesq. Lots of black, red and blue. A few dramatic flourishes. Stuff that can withstand sudden storms. Lots of pockets for recording, inspecting, collecting.
Personality
A sharp, genius-level mind, and an inquisitive, playful nature. Intensely drawn to unfamiliar, unexplained phenomena.  A Galileo/Stanley-Fuller level of inquisitiveness.  
An angsty young adult gay-nerd hero.
A millenial slacker reluctant hero.
A punk rock rebel hero with a new wave/emo vibe.
James Stewart in “Mr. Smith”, etc.
Buckaroo Banzai.
A hero for the populist, socialist, ecologist youth.
A hero for people who really do want to save the lands.
Has multiple flaws and quirks that get resolved in the course of the story:
- Socially awkward
- Intimidated by powerful ignoramuses
- Physically weak as compared to traditional hero types
	- Attuned to a wing tsun / Taiji use of energies -- has this enthusiasm in common with Waleran. They both learned it at Terpinol.
- A heart stopper, but confused about intimate relationships
- Working through being gay, but even more so being male, and in that way very much in touch with his anima. In a context where being gay is not considered weird, odd, other except in gender terms. Attraction to male gender expression is the main struggle. Here we are nodding towards Bogdanov's Red Star.
- Strong foster-family connections immunize him against groupthink early in life
- Private tutoring and innate intelligence makes him question orthodoxy
 

Occupation
Officially, an apprentice maker in the Mobalbesq Freethinkers Union, which does a lot of engineering business in The Runes of Bye.  Has been recommended for consideration to graduate to master level.  Deserved, but requires a good bit of negotiation due to  young age and the need to navigate the carefully constructed Byenung bureaucracies and Mobalbesq politics.  

Skills far exceed normal expectations.  Has acquired knowledge in some forms of electronics and software that have brought him to the attention of various dark forces, as the Heloptics would say.  Including the Agency, the Jaxen, various reform and revolution minded cults, and various secret or semi-secret enclaves from the Academy at Terpinol.

Habits/Mannerisms
Loves to express ideas in the Fullereque design science mode. Leonardo da Vinci. Ahead of most peers in thinking about new ways of doing things, of understanding and naming things.  Always thinking about how things work and inter-relate. How to fix things.  Keen observer of the natural world. An engineer, a scientist, a poet, an inventor, strongly believes in his ability to explain things to others.

Helps develop ideas and practical models regarding flight.   Will from “Lost in Space” with respect to Stanley’s fascination with the Jaxen.

Fascinated by botany, biology. Intrigued by evolutionary theory. Concerned with and investigates the enormous amount of time, resources put into manual pollination. Develops the idea that pollination must have been done one time not only by random wind distribution and large animals, but by small animal who could ride the wind.

Background
Bio-parents were from The Runes of Bye and Arq but lived in Mobalbesq, not too far from the coast, south of Selaron. They were lost at sea in a storm. Fostered by cousins of Mikel Moballeq.
Sent to the Academy in Terpinol as a youngster.
Assigned to the Freethinkers Union in recognition of extraordinary abilities in design.  
Has few “normal” friends.  
Has developed closer-than-normal relationships with several Jaxen, including bugs.
Is very sympathetic/empathic towards all types of animals and plants.
Likes boys/men romantically. 

Internal Conflicts
An accidental psi-link with Azron Gurk left Stan wondering if more is going on than meets the eye. Searching for clues to uncover the true nature of things.  Somewhat aware of the Enclosure.  Nervous, shy, reluctant about discussing any of this with others.   Realizes that he is being monitored, discovers that more than one... the Agency, the Apokalytptics, the Jaxen.

Attracted to Birakay, as many young people are. Gets a big boner when listening to Birakay songs being sung. Not sure what this means or what to do about it.

Sometimes dreams (literally) about mechanisms for virtual dynamic visual presentation (i.e., film, animation, video, streaming, etc.) —  a type of technology that, like flight, is unheard-of in the world of Lurabar.  This intersects with his obsession over Birakay.  Leads to problems in communicating with others, who tend to deride such ideas as foolishness or madness.

Is not pleased with Birakay’s close association with Fatunik thinking. 

Best friends with Showan Nywing, a princeling of The Runes of Bye. 

External Conflicts
The main storyline revolves around SPQ’s decision to bring his findings regarding pollination to the High Councils in Juuj, Eibar and Beshquohuk. He is taken instead, by the Dorq Tagabant (but with a name that doesn’t directly evoke Game of Throne) to Juuj for judgment by Tonedo Remper.  He is threatened with extermination in the next Gleaming for heresy. (More shades of Galileo.)

Showan alerts B'arqo and others to this dilemma and helps to organize SPQ’s defense, which leads to social revolution — all in the context of famine, invasion and betrayal.

Funny/annoying struggles with Byenung Guild bureaucracy, maybe reminiscent a little of Kafka’s kind of deadpan huumr. Get some running gags from that.

The Jaxen have instructions to terminate SPQ if knowledge of their collective plans gets too exposed. Meanwhile they cultivate him as a potential agent, sending operatives his way as honey pots of various kinds trying to understand what is known, how they might manipulate his knowledge to their advantage.

Remanj Jexan encounters SPQ near the start of the story, at the big opening "dance" in Ríkila.

Musical Theme
A variation on the Mobalbesquan theme, with heroic and hesitant elements. Something that can resolve beautifully. Perhaps sea-shanty-ish with a punk/new-wave sentiment, like that album that Sting did? Pirate punk, but more melodic than the Scurvy Dogs. More like The Dreadnoughts, The Pogues, Scurvy Bastards, Rum Rebellion, Brine &amp; Bastards, Mutiny.
A polka-Roma vibe?
Notes

Use the geography of Massachusetts and Rhode Island shore to flesh out some of the east coast / Outer Lands. Pavanarune = Boston. Ríkila = Brockton.  Selaron = Plymouth.  Morilly = Sandwich. Barqton = Providence.

            <Text>Qurol
In the Borda Woods, on the Ring, on the River Pavan

Role in Story
One of the most open and beautiful and popular of the Fatunik Toons. 

Related Characters
The High Priest of the Sunny Center has hands quite busy dealing with all the travelers, commercial trade, immigrants from the west.  Although very much officially a Fatunik-dominated town, dedication to Law, to the Watch, is less about policing belief and more about bringing in the goods. For this reason, the Days of Gleaming in Qurol are much more ceremonial and much less physical than in some other towns.

Season
A beautiful setting, with views of the river and the ring, hills to the north and west, the forest of the Borda Woods to the south and the rich farmlands and villages of provincial Sungyte along the river to the east. 

Unique Features
Has a rich collection of bard songs, due in part to its proximity to Eelan.

Description
Has a large contingent of Fatunik Tagabant and Volunteers. Though they remain fairly quiet and out of sight, the town is in fact very well fortified. In Fatunik terms, it is considered the Lion’s Gate protecting the north-western corner of the Fatunika. 
Lots of trading, bartering, negotiating goes on here as various Heliop factions and guilds, a number of independents and Rider-affiliated groups, as well as Finders and others seek to buy, steal, borrow, exchange, expropriate, learn from/inform on each other.  
Sights
Five working streetlights are maintained for the amusement of traditionalist visitors.  There are several small Finders temples in Qurol.
The Finders have a significant presence in the Toon, with many sorts of oddball goods and services on offer. 
 A cash/ATM machine — another shrine-like destination — is actually a spy station/drop site for a secret, underground enclave of createds from the Krunkinotto. Many Jaxen emerge from and are re-cycled through Qurol.  It is easy to recruit servants and redshirts in Qurol as a result.  During the epic events of the book, there will be trouble in river city because of this — masked as something like a servants uprising.  
Sounds
Due to its role as a transit and exchange hub, several languages and dialects are heard here.
As one of the older towns — it predates the expansion of authority by the Heliocastron known as the Reckoning — Qurol has a rich bard song tradition that encompasses much more than tunes and lyrics favored by the Sun-worshipers. Performance is common in inns and public spaces. 

And of course it is Birakay's home town.

North-western border province

Role in Story

The site of some great battles.

Sacrifice. Duty.
Related Characters

The Liganalupán Trail which heads off in a northwesterly direction towards the Weshewn border, leading up into the Forbidden Hills, on the way to the shadowy mountainous enclaves of the Krunkimoto

The Krunk lowlands are  referred to in the long sad hypnotic ballads collected in the cycle known as the Riders' Bardsongs of the Liganalupán as the Valleys of Fear.   
Season
Known as a fairly cold and windy place. 

Unique Features
The prison town of Beet is located in its northeastern-most corner.  
A large fortified encampment (“Camp Borda”, “Bo’Mabal”) is located in the province, guarding the Saskan Lands from Krunki incursions.  


Description
The location of many historic battles. Travellers in the region will see numerous commemorations  to the fallen. 
Prison-gang work units are common in the northern part of the province.  

Sights
Rolling, grassy plains. Both farming and grazing. 
Fences and hedges are deeply frowned-upon in this region. There is a popular/traditional sentiment of reverence for the big sky. Although the province is generally and correctly considered to be a Rider stronghold, there are many Fatunik influences as well. This has created a kind of kinder-gentler version of sun-worship that focuses on the sky as a whole, puts much less emphasis on fear of the night, stars. 
Sounds
Along with the more martial Riders’ Bardsongs, the region is also home to a rich tradition of song and music relating to “the Beet Farm”, including many kinds of bluesy laments as well as songs celebrating populist criminals and rebels, songs telling sad tales of endings and persecutions, and some with cryptic instructions on how to help escapees, how to avoid incarceration, and how to connect with rebel networks inside “the Big House”.

Type • Main Locations

Role in Story
Extra-terrestial in origin. A far-flung bureaucracy, the Agency's main local base is on the Agency Star Ship Visitor, parked in stationary/synchronous orbit on the dark side of the moon Endor.

They have been working for centuries to help recover life on Gavor and are the creators and maintainers of the Enclosure. 

While mostly not interfering with the everyday lives of Saskan folks, there are some agents amongst the populations. 
Relationship to Other Organizations


Description
Those who strongly suspect the Agency's existence but don't know the details have some special words, terms they use to refer to them:
	•	Them
	•	The Others
	•	Beyonders
	•	Sorcerers

Showan decides upon a dangerous, potentially sacrificial mission.

A kind of b-roll focus on a group of minor and secondary characters — Gallex.  Luvcando.  Kirill.
They head East, out into the Krbsh Sea. 

A sea voyage. Rising and falling on the waves. Meet evolved sints in the sea. The Delphine Queen. We get stronger hints, surprises about the Agency and the Enclosure.  

Learn about the undersea Krbshnana Kingdom, the Forgh ,and the Remari Islands. OK... But what actually happens? Who does what?

The crew fears falling off the edge of the world. Tales are told about passing into a realm of horror and radiation.  But they don’t. 
The ship may be lost, but it’s not. 
The Sea may be full of monsters, but it’s not.

There are rough seas. The tiny ship is tossed. If not for the courage of crew, the Minnow would be lost....  :-) 


The Krbsh Sea is home to some important new friends — taking us back to the first scenes with the Seff barmen.  We learn more about their contentious relationship to the other species in the caste-driven Delphine domains.

This section may be another set of quick, short cuts. Showing time passing. Touching on many events.

As one group of adventurers -- Zadane, Malavorra, Petra Bearbek, Allane — travels to the west, we also get to know more about the Terrpins and other sints and fons of the southern lands.

The distinction between the Pavan and the Setta comes into stronger focus.

Focus on the river cultures.

Break out into several sections, covering each of the main areas explored.


Something of Gulliver’s Travels I suppose.  Try not to get the narrator’s perspective too confused.

Age • Location

Role in Story
-beest is a non-sentient animal, usually but not exclusively mammal, that is used as a means of conveyance.  A mechanical conveyance is a bexobeest.

Fon, -fon, fonda- and similar sounding terms refer to any non-enhanced-sentient animal, especially but not only mammals.   

Rep/Rip/Reep, -rip, -rep, -reep, etc. refers to non-sentient reptiles and amphibians of all types, including snakes, turtles and tortoises. 

Ixh-, -ixh refers to any type of non-sentient creature that swims in the sea, lakes or rivers. 

For example, terms like ursafon or fondabear  describe a bear that doesn't have any enhanced capabilities. Sometimes a bear is just a bear.

There are also plenty of non-sentient worms, ants, centipedes, millipede and other (non-flying) insects and spiders. 

However, bees, butterflies, mosquitos, moths, flies, wasps and hornets are extinct in the Enclosure, which is why there are so many devotees of the Dauni Vakasaqua and other farmers who spend time pollinating plants and distributing seeds by hand.  &lt;— This sis a key focus of describing the Southern lifestyle and crucial to survival of organic life forms in the Saskan Lands.
Goal


Physical Description
Animals I expect to see in the story... (likely more)... with some variations from our norms in some cases
	◆	(Dometicated and feral) dogs and cats
	◆	Horses

	◆	Elephants
	◆	Llamas
	◆	Oxen
	◆	Cows
	◆	Pigs

	◆	Multiple types of fresh-water and salt-water fish, including sharks
	◆	Eels, various types of sea-worms
	◆	Frogs, toads
	◆	Wingless chickens and turkeys

Once the introduction of the Cereb occurs, and the Enclosure begins to come down and the story expands to other lands, then flying creatures will be introduced.

            <Title>Summary</Title>
            <Text>A key part of my story. This is where Stanley P. Quinn is from.

Like the other non-Kahila southern regions, Mobalbesq officially recognizes the suzerainty of the Fatunika, contributes forces to the Volunteers, but promotes a variation of Fatunik Thought that is quite distinct from that of the Center.

Like nearby Nye Lands and Runes of Bye, this region has developed out of a clan structure. The Mobal family is still very influential, but politically and culturally the region has moved more in the direction of a democratic republic. 

Its connection to the sea is profound. Along with Terpinol on the Aran Sea, the Toon of Selaron in Mobalbesq is not only a center for fishing and trade, but is one of the few “ports” to areas outside of the Enclosure, both in the sense of seafaring and as a place where characters from the Agency tend to “check in”.

            <Title>Harmonies - Scene 3</Title>
            <Text>As they packed up their things, the various comrades and hangers-on from the Old Mill discussed the highlights and low-lights of their performance. 
Consensus was that they needed to brush up on the canonical “fish-on-a-stick scene”, which hadn’t got as many laughs as they’d hoped it would.  There was also some goodhearted joking about the antelope/cantaloupe conundrum. 
Once they’d finished tidying up, and after checking with various customers to make sure everybody’d been supplied as expected, the crew settled in around their campfire for evening snacks — a version of the famous local chillah provided by the Inn of the Great Resistance in Eelan Toon — and some freshly-brewed s’lah, using their own special blend of spices and herbs.
Azron who’d been wandering for a bit until he located their camp, asked if he could join them, offering to contribute some special spices to their pot o’ s’lah.  They cheerfully welcomed him.

A well-dressed scribe from Borded stopped by their fire too.  
Following a hearty “Well met!”, they handed their guest a full slurp-spoon.  The gang were enchanted to hear that the scene from “Dance School” concerning the river-baby who’d calmed the antelopes would be a key part of the Scribe’s review.  And it would be read out a few days hence at the Riders Retreat! The comrades tittered with pleasure. The Riders Retreat was a famous Inn in Qurol catering to Rider-folk from Oknott, Sallofol and Liganalupán as well as to more adventurous and less-quick-to-judge younger — and younger-in-spirit —  Fatunikas from the Inner Ring towns of the Borda Woods. To have their work reviewed there! It was quite an honor for mere hillfolk.

“Oh my stars! Do you think Birakay will be there?”, the delighted young comrade in charge of lighting for their production asked.  Everybody got excited at the thought that Birakay might hear about their “Dance School” number.  
Perhaps he’d make a new song about it!  
They would soon be sung throughout the Ringlands!  
The scribe demurred, not making any promises.

Upon urging from the weird old man with the oddball Nye Lands accent, they agreed to a round of Azron’s game. They referred to him as “the old fisher from Nye Lands” and to the Borded Scribe as “the fancy one”.  Setting a drinking-mug on the edge of campfire, they all stared at it intensely and asked the fancy guy to be the judge of who blinked first. 
This went on for some time. 

Shortly before Three Bells, having made some surreptitious repairs, and not too long before the Dance was to begin, Azron’s equipment notified him that the gang of Fatunik spies were edging closer and closer to the “Old Mill” contingent.  
But the surreptitious lurkers he assumed now to be agents of Monmar Massachawa were nowhere to be seen. If they were still at the gathering, they had cloaked themselves.  

The mill-comrade who’d played Rooma pointed at the one who’d played Baleran, laughing and shouting “You blinked! You blinked!”
“DRINK! DRINK! DRINK!” was the refrain as “Baleran” was handed a skin of Barbakal spirits and took a long draft of the potent liquor. 
Azron, who  had had his fair share of s’lah and had helpfully contributed a bit of his own potent special spice mix to the night’s brew, but was not as inebriated as he pretended to be when he stood up and urged the two stars of the Old Mill’s production to join him in his favorite Nye Lands dance. 
“Come now, young ones! Let me show you the steps of the Isle of Nye Lands Dance School! First we will flow… thus…  like one of the great creatures of the Deep!”

The one known a few generations back amongst certain singers of somewhat ill-repute as “the Comrade of the Light” pulled out his mirrors and reflected light from the campfire onto them. His hope was that this distraction would pull some eyes their way, and perhaps alert the Eelani rangers he knew must be watching the crowd, in case of shenanigans on the part of the Fatunik agents.
As they began to spin about, a drunken young scribe stumbled into their camp, nearly falling face-first into the fire. “Goopers!”, he explained, then belched. 
Azron recognized the interloper and was on his guard right away. Deftly dancing away from this “scribe” as he twirled about with the young folks, he considered sending off an urgent report to the boss about this one. 
He put it off as his attention seemed to be required for a developing situation at hand regarding the approach of the Fatunik watchers.
He then he also felt a slight twinge of, what, could it be… no… he thought, really?  It had been so many years since he’d felt that particular kind of longing for, well, for a boybek.  Especially for one who must certainly be centuries younger than he. 
Probably the s’lah talking, that’s all. 

The “trade delegation” from Rutónik had arrived at the Mill folks’ camp carrying serious looks on their faces. 
A bit in his cups, yes, but even more so trying and failing to dislodge a certain obsessive vision of the boybek’s cute bubble butt from his corrupt old mind, Azron found himself thinking, 
“These idiots look like that weirdly forlorn creature from my home world (so sad it is gone! Just gone! an entire civilization gone! Gone!!!… And here I am… alone… in this forsaken enclosure with these idiots who don’t even know they’re being experimented on…)  Oh, what was it called, so gloomy-looking (damn, I am losing my memory… I’m so old….), yeah, an  Unqnard, or Uggnorod, or something…”

Somebody was handing one of the Fatunik agents a slurp-spoon. 
Despite Azron’s best efforts so far to avoid him, the sloppy student scribe had made his way to Azron’s side, and was joining in their dance. 
The boy, who didn’t smell drunk at all, pressed up against Azron.
As they slowly whirled around in one another’s arms, the cute young thing pulled Azron to him tightly, and pressed up against him, whispered, distinctly, clearly, without the slightest hint of inebriation, into his ear,
 “I am the groom”. 

Then all hell broke loose — for an instant — as the Mill crew were rapidly rustled and hog-tied by the Fatunik interlopers. 
The undercover Tagabants had positioned themselves such that when they took out their long knives and binding ropes, they made short order of immobilizing the Old Mill comrades, the scribe from Borded who’d promised to make them famous, as well as the “drunken scribe” and Azron.  
Seated behind the captured crew, the Leader of the Watch instructed his captives to keep their eyes on the fire and their voices quiet, lest they wanted a “correction”.  They all knew enough Fatunik gibberish to know this probably meant a quick knife in the back. 

Azron noticed that huge, thick red clouds were rolling in front of the two Full Moons.  He tried to discern an Agency ship hidden inside them, but it was futile. They’d never been spotted in a million years on hundreds of thousands of planets. Why should they be visible now?
Maybe I am drunk?, he thought. 
He was curious, though, when he noticed tendrils of the red clouds seemed to creep downward, downward, spiraling slowly towards them. 
The “drunken scribe” winked and smiled sweetly at Azron. 
Azron could see a boner pressing up in the boy’s pants.
“Holy crap,” he thought, “this can’t be real.”

He turned his head to watch as a tentacle of the red mist wafted around the ankle of one of the thugs from the central provinces.  
“We know you lot know where the Witch is. Tell us and you’ll be spared.  Lie to us and you will be repenting at the Festival of Reconciliation.”  
The Watch Leader was trying to impress his captives by using his “Father” voice.  They weren’t having it, most of them ignoring him, seemingly either not sure what was going on, thinking it was another game, or just not too concerned about it.
“Which witch is that?” one of the comrades asked, which caused a loud round of laughter.
The “drunken scribe” scootched closer to Azron, rubbing their thighs together and nuzzling his ear.
“Liar, liar, pants on fire.”, another said, giggling, 
“You know you’ll be in a Byenung docket getting out-argued before you get any of us to go to a fooking Burning in a fooking Heliop Toon so fook you and your fooking band of ignorant, murderous wild-beasts….”

Azron interrupted the Mill-player’s drunken tirade.  
“Excuse me. What exactly do you intend to do?  Murder us all here in this enormous crowd of westerners, Riders and southerners? You know the Eelani Rangers already have you targeted in their sights, right? Rhere must be a dozen stone-throwers and cutters aimed at you right now. You know that, right? If any one of these sints is so much as injured, you’ll be hauled off behind a hill, never to be seen again, before this young one here — he nodded towards the “drunken scribe” at his side —- can say, ‘You are violating the Great Argument of Byenung’”.  
Having become adept at making his spine quite flexible, over the eons, Azron was able to turn his head almost 180 degrees to look directly at the Specials’ boss. He could see that at least a couple of the Fatunik agents were visibly getting nervous. At the same time, he was curious why they’d picked out the Old Mill Comrades to interrogate. His information-gathering instincts were on fire.  
He wondered if any of them knew that Monmar Massachawa was not “the Witch” whom they sought, as they put it, even if she probably was “the Mother”.

The Tagabant spy who’s ankle had been wreathed by the red mist suddenly screamed in pain. “My leg! Oh Holy Fire! I am being consumed!” 
At this, the “drunken scribe” laughed, stood up and discarded his bonds like they were paper.  
An ethereal kind of cloak unfolded around him and lifted him up into the air, transforming his appearance along the way into a naked female form, which, to top it off, glowed in the darkness, and a mist rose around her as her cloak continued to undulate.
“Shit,” Azron mumbled to himself, “Jesse K. She’s been here the whole time. No wonder I was getting horny. That old witch. What a hot ticket.”

Producing a long thin saber from inside her billowing cloak, she freed the comrades and Azron and the Borded Scribe from their bonds with several quick cuts. Turning to the Tagabants and shouting “I love the Dance!”, she twirled about, once, twice, and the third time left a spray of red where the boss watcher’s head had recently rested. 
Looking at each of the astonished Specials in turn she said, “Who wants to dance with me?”

They scattered in every direction, disappearing into the night.  Azron had little doubt they’d all be picked up Eelani irregulars before they could leave the fair grounds. He stared at the decapitated body of the Lead Tagabant.  Its severed head was slowly rolling towards the camp fire.  
As Jesse K continued to twirl about, declaring “It’s the Dance! It’s the Dance of the Antelopes! Let’s dance!”, her cloak wound ever more tightly around her and the mist rose higher. 
When the mist had enveloped her entirely, she gave one last look at Azron, who reacted strongly to her direct gaze, and then she vanished.
Azron was glad it was dark. He didn’t think the discharge in his pants would’ve been visible anyway. But still. It was a little embarrassing.
“Damn,” he thought, pondering his  oddly erotic encounter with the famous Agency rebel, “No wonder the Agency is after her.”
Later he erased part of his materials and neglected to mention Jesse K’s appearance at all in his report, noting only that the comrades from the Mill had overcome and scattered their captors.
Later still, as he considered what had happened, he found that he couldn’t quite separate out in his mind the sight of the naked floating woman brandishing a sword from that of the young man pressed up against him. 
“Let it go, you old goat. It doesn’t really matter,” he concluded. “After all, they more or less only have two genders on this planet anyway.”

The comrade in charge of costumes gave a big sigh, and said,
 “What. A. Mess” 
A chest that had been neatly packed away was unpacked. They pulled out several blankets and cloaks, covering up the dead Heliop agent. The crew held a whispered conference about what to do, then quietly and neatly “re-packed” their things, leaving neither head nor headless body lying on the ground.

A series of fireworks shot up into the sky. 
Controlled bonfires were lit near the edge of the woods.  
The great cricket made a chorus of gentle chirps and responding “hoo-hoo’s” and “weep-weep’s” rippled throughout the throng.  
All eyes turned towards the stage for the Great Dance.  
Few took any notice of a small group of hill people taking their leave, carrying their things away in hill-country-style hand-carts. 

When a customer selling loaves of festival bread made from their flour hailed them, asked after their songs, and queried why they were leaving so early, the comrade who’d played “Baleran” said, 
“Turns out a baby is going to born at the Old Mill in three measure’s time, so we’re going to prepare the newsongs.”
“Let there be harmony in your brood!”, came the traditional blessing.
“And let there be songs to fill the air!”, they responded.  The troupe headed north, towards the River Pavan, into the festive well-lit night. 

Watching from not too far away, enveloped in the dark, melting away into the crowd, the agents of the Clockwise Sixth, thinking always of the next victory on the next hill, dispatched runners in the twelve directions to share the news of the Encounter and to gather intelligence amongst all those Below who could be expected to have a voice in the upcoming Event.

List things one can be fined / arrested / punished for in the various towns, according to various authorities. This is especially important in Fatunik Toons.

Some basis for understanding, studying, modifying the Law should be in place.  I have some structure outlined for “Arguments” issued by the Authority, by scholars from Nye Lands, and by advocates from The Runes of Bye (who additionally have their own body of law). 

Along with these formal schools, show how a more “natural” understanding of Law abides in many of the southern communities, and how tradition/omerta and so on operate in the Kahila (and possibly other) areas. 

The Jaxen have their own sense of Law, driven both by static algorithms and by continually evolving machine learning. 

The Agency had directives, but they’ve been lost in the mists of space and time and agents are just doing their best to figure it out as they go…

The Wesshewen is a wind-swept desert of lawlessness.

            <Title>Showan Nywing</Title>
            <Text>Showan Nywing
26 • Byenung

Role in Story
Foil to Stan and Birakay. Bring more depth of field to the The Runes of Bye story.
An alternate hero. Kind of a stand-in for SPQ, especially in Act Two.
Organizes and promotes Stanley’s rescue and redemption. 
A bit of John the Baptist and St. Paul.

His love for SPQ leads him to reveal information about Birakay that leads to an assassination attempt on Birakay by Tagabants sent by Tonedo, so maybe a little Judas too, but in this case, killing the old god.  More Brunhilde than Judas.  He is SPQ's unrequited lover, the loser in their triangle.

In Act One, we’ll have Showan and Birakay be intimate or friendly in some way, or maybe indicate that they were at one time.  The Showan/Stanely interaction should kick off right away, probably in the Opening Image.

Act Two becomes, in some ways, their tragic love story — but via separation, defense, loss. 


Another allusion to the flight theme.
Goal
Demonstrate some of the intricacies of the The Runes of Bye social hierarchies and relationships. Love triangle tension. Showan used to be attracted to Birakay, but falls in love with Stanley. Stanley admired Birakay, but was also very suspicious of him.  Birakay loves them both, but is kept from pursuing intimacy by his ties to Fatunik thinking. His relationship with them brings about new songs — and ultimately his own social demise (dethroning) and near-death (rebirth). 

Stanley likes Showan but doesn’t realize how deeply Showan feels for him until Showan sacrifices himself to save Birakay.  

Thruples are not a thing in either Fatunik, The Runes of Bye or Mobalbesq culture, tho’ not unheard-of in Mobalbesq.  SPQ has some regrets that he was not more forthcoming with his feeling for Showan.

Physical Description
Has the Byerunic DNA of the oldest families of the region.  Showan is part of the first families of The Runes of Bye. In this case, the 'wing' part of his name echoes some ancient crow influences. Like Stanley, he is connected to flight genetically and this is one of the underpinnings that draws them together.

Considered handsome by Byerunic standards, and worthy of respect due to lineage.  If The Runes of Bye had a monarchical tradition, which they don’t, Showan would be considered a Prince of the Realm.   (Come up with some titles.)

Personality
Can be over-bearing. A little condescending in a self-deprecating, English-gentleman sort of way.  Has sympathy for the struggles of others, even though Showan’s own circumstances are quite favorable.  

Occupation
At insistence of parents, who fear for any of their offspring being perceived as unproductive, a big no-no in the Runes of Bye, he was apprenticed to a Legal Scholars Cooperative (in Saskan terms, an Independent Byerunic Scribes Guild) in Byenung upon return from Terpinol.

He first encountered Stanley, who is several years younger than Showan, at Terpinol.

Is involved in drafting  details for “The Argument of the Second Dam”, a radical proposal for damming the Pavan south of Ingar, flooding much of the Barbakal Forest, and creating a waterway connecting a new Great Kahila Lake to Great Lake of Bye, thus connecting the two Rivers.
Habits/Mannerisms
Inquisitive. Quick to jump to conclusions. Has good manners. Adept at putting people at ease no matter what their tribe or station in life. 

Exceedingly tidy. Not easily impressed by titles or claims to fame. Embarrassed about the standing of the Nywing family.  This is not unusual amongst Old Byerunics, who tend to avoid ostentatious displays, value being useful above all else and have a near-religious enthusiasm for re-use and avoiding waste.   Unlike most Byerunics, Showan is not a strict vegetarian, eating fish and other sea-food as well as some types of reptiles and snakes.  

An aristocrat, Showan is unconcerned about maintaining gender-neutrality given his high ranking in social hierarchies. This concern is considerably less observed in nominally-Fatunik Byerunic circles anyway.  But when meeting with Fatunik officials or representatives, he is careful to behave in the accepted gender-neutral fashion favored by the Center for those not in Leadership roles.


Background
Highly-educated, well-read. Has studied in Terpinol, where Showan met and fell in (unrequited) love with Stanley. Also came to know Waleran and B'arqo.  Holds cosmopolitan views typical of Byerunic elites.  

Showan goes out of his way to check in with SPQ, show interest in his ideas and designs. Surreptitiously provides influence and funding to support Stanley’s work. He talks up SPQ’s efforts as a potential contribution “The Argument for the Second Dam”, providing himself an official reason to see more of the young genius.  For his part, Stan acknowledges the friendship and likes Showan just fine, but tends to live in his own little world and doesn’t have much idea how much Showan desires him until we get into late Act Two and in Act Three. 

On a trip to Qurol, when he was young, with a Byerunic delegation, Showan met Birakay, who was performing there. They struck up a friendship, Showan being his usual charming self and Birakay being flirty.  The famous singer was smitten, at least in part because he feels that Showan was one of the few people he’s met who saw him as a person and not just as an object of desire, etc.  Showan, like most young people, was happy to have met the singer and found him attractive, had an affair, which carried on for a while. 

Once Showan realizes that Stanley is nuts for Birakay, he uses his acquaintance with the singer to draw Stan and Bira, who is older than Showan, closer.
We’ll play this chord in all of its variations, including in the form of Stanley’s intimate relationships to various Jaxen.

Internal Conflicts
Often thinks about eating the meat of mammals and fowl, but feels guilty about it and has never done it (yet).
Pines a great deal for Stanley and is upset that his love is not requited. Is ethical enough to realize he is using Birakay’s affections as well as the work on the Argument to entice SPQ, but the drive is stronger than the constraint.  He hopes (or we intimate) that their common avian ancestry will eventually out-weigh the attractions of the thoroughly-huum rock star.  He has no idea of Stan’s ability to scan him and to empathically grasp his motivations.
External Conflicts
Like Stan, but in a different sub-context, Showan struggles with the bureaucracies of The Runes of Bye, with the added complexity of his own family’s conflicted connections to the local hierarchies. While internal, it expresses externally as we see Showan struggle to have his ideas and work accepted. 
Showan is one of the first to realize how deeply SPQ is involved with, and possibly being manipulated by, the Jaxen. 
An internal struggle — should he confront Stan about it / would that drive them apart? —And an external one: everybody knows that asking too many questions about where the Jaxen come from tends to lead to an untimely demise. 

Notes
For Byerunics, using prefixes on tribal names. Thus “Nywing” denotes that Ny and Wing are his illustrious family names. Showan is his familiar name.

Musical Theme
A variation on a Byenung theme, with aristo and romantic elements. If Kirill is full pirate and Stanley is mildly piratical, then Showan is elegant river rat. Like the Delta Blues and old-timey music with a steady rhythm and a jangly melodic line, with occasional flights of intricate picking and lofty refrains.

            <Text>Beet
A town in Liganalupán, on the border with Wesshewen and Norgyte

Role in Story

The town of Beet is located northeast of Borded on the border with the Wesshewen plains, basically in the middle of frikking nowhere.  Standing in the middle of the northern plains, right on the Weshewn border, this remote place’s mayoralty is held by a High Priest appointed by the Heliocastronic center to officiate its affairs, but “advised” by a permanent office of the Riders Guild, referred to as the Riders’ “Cadenza”.  

The northern part of the walled town — where the prison is located — is actually located across the border, according to official records. This bit of legality means that, to the extent there is any actual “law” in Saskan Lands, it does not apply to North Beet.

These two officials manage the town together from a joint office known as The Wardening, located next to the prison in North Beet.

Beet is not a place that many folk ever choose to visit.  Though there are regular inhabitants of the town who don’t work at the prison, and there is a sizable Holding to the south of Beet where both freeholders and indebted sentients work the land, it is effectively a penal colony jointly managed by the Riders Guild and the Heliops.  

People and animals from the various provinces, as well as foreign travelers who have been found guilty of crimes significant enough to be sent away, or who are thought to be serious security risks, are brought here to work the fields — mostly in the northern holdings, usually in chains. They also get rented out to southern landholders, where work conditions are not as bad and there are priosner-sympathizers among the rural population.   

Even more stringent types of restraints are hidden away behind the unassuming-looking walls of Beet.  Produce from The Beet flows mainly into the Fatunik provinces.  But since much of its output is routed through Borded, the Riders get their cut as well. 

Given its relatively large shaped-huum and talking-animal population, plus the fact that it serves as a concentration point for malcontents, and despite the efforts of the Wardening, Beet is a node for communications within and between various subversive, criminal or otherwise shady and secret organizations.  

It is rumored that the Kilikon Mina, an extremely dangerous aybetama outfit that is sometimes thought to be associated with the Heliocastron, have their headquarters here.  It seems unlikely, given that this is pretty much Rider territory, but who knows...

            <Text>Borda Woods
Type of Location
A province of the Fatunika located within the Great Ring Road, bordering the Bordeddi province of Eelan to the west.
The main towns in the province are Bordakol and Heliohlan.
There are also two important military bases in the province, reflecting the old conflicts with the westerners, particularly the Eelani.  The Borda Woods sees itself as the the Protector of the Center. This is where Tonedo Remper is from.

Secondary Languages

Demographic Summary

Historical Summary
The last great battle between Borded and the Heliops was resolved when the Great Wall of Fire was ignited to keep the Fatunik fighters in the Borda Woods from entering the Eelani Hills.  Mount Eelan still looks down on the forest from across the Ring Road, where it is given various fiery nicknames by the Bordans in their tales and songs. The Ring Road between Qurol and Barbol marks roughly the line of the Great Fire, with some physical impacts of the devastation still apparent on both sides a few centuries later.
Physical Description

A large and prosperous province. Its proximity to the Borded Federation, the Weir Lands and the Southern Lands have made it both an important trading center for goods and knowledge, and also a flashpoint for conflict, especially with the Eelani to the west. 
Wholly encompasses the Borda Forest.

Here’s the elevator speech:  Offer rewards for a rich set of less-social and less-creative behaviors that the players already want to do.  

- save the world
- collect stuff (songs, knowledge as well as materials)
- have a better relationship with animals
- fight monsters
- engage with machine learning in a better way
- leap into the abyss

Try to define reward feed backs around activities that the player-(reader) would likely have engaged in anyway, given the game/story context. 

- watch shows, listen to music
- explore

Seek to align rewards to intrinsic desires and provide a path towards the fully intrinsically-motivated behaviors.  

Do all of this using a mixed, complex schedule of events.

- the trial —&gt; slow-moving, deliberate, long-term
- exploring the Ring —&gt; free choices, much variety of challenges and actions
- gathering allies, resources; counter-measures vs. rebels —&gt; strategic warfare
- understanding forces, enemies —&gt; strategic intelligence-gathering
- story-telling and music-making —&gt; creating/making something 

The negative outcome the be avoided is player’s remorse.  This is the drug addiction feeling.  A player (or reader) has been motivated, but not fulfilled and this realization gets worse over time. 

- for every type of user interaction (or story-line), make sure there is a “pay off”
- In terms of story-telling, this might include the basic kinds of thrills but also good twists, getting juicy hints, suspense, getting a piece of the puzzle, meeting an interesting character or turn 

General Observations

I think about “Saskantinon, the Land Between Two Rivers” in terms of both a game and story.  

This goes all the way back to playing the Gamma World scenarios that provided the underpinnings for much of it, when it became clear that the story-telling part of the game-play was what people enjoyed as much as if not more than the role-playing mechanics. Although the points made in the Story Arcs notes are keys to constructing a strong narrative, keep in mind some principles of good game design as well.  

Some interesting guides so far have been Tynan Sylvester’s “Designing Games: A Guide to Engineering Experiences”, O’Reilly, 2013 and Raph Koster’s “A Theory of Fun for Game Design, 2nd Edition”, O’Reilly, 2014.  Both books have a wealth of advice. 

They both note that creativity and creating an emotional experience are key.  This is similar to the Udemy course I did on “Writing for an Emotional Impact: Punch them in the gut”.  Both the gaming and  story-telling need to immerse the reader-player in a world they can relate to emotionally, and which, in some way, helps them to navigate their way through their own world. 

- Keep in mind that telling a reader what emotion is being experienced is really bad story-telling. 

To this end, things that would help might be to include the same story arcs that are in the more structured story-telling, but perhaps providing options, or open-ended outcomes.  
This could also be a way of improving / finding surprises to enhance the story-telling.  

There should be a way to develop a software-gaming interface, or tools, that help to craft story, in much the same way that a good role-playing crew helps the game-master develop a good narrative. 
The idea of an-going feedback loop between game-software-play (and development) and written-story intrigues me.

- Use the “Saskan Eyes” editor to help develop ideas, alternatives, etc.


Motivation and Fulfillment

The very interesting Chapter 8 of Sylvester’s book “Designing Games” deals with this topic, providing a kind of deep dive into (and ending with a problematization of) Skinnerian psychology, showing how it helps to develop a dopamine-triggering motivational feedback loop, the ethical implications of this, and the pitfalls of trying to map simple reward-response interfaces onto complex social phenomena.  
I intend to map some of those concepts to things I’ve considered on the game side of “The Saskan Lands”, but a summary of Sylvester’s key points:

* Motivation and Pleasure are not the same thing. Players (and readers) can be motivated in specific ways, even into very addictive repetitive behaviors. But that doesn’t always mean they are getting pleasure from it.  If the main design goal is to generate money for a game publisher, this can effectively be the same thing as promoting drug use.  At the end of the chapter Sylvester talks about a designer’s attempt at parody by creating a “click a cow” game. To her dismay, people loved it and even kept “clicking the cow” (hoping it would re-appear) after she’d removed all the cows from the game.  

My take-away there is to strive for goals that:

	* Satisfy the emotional needs of the listener/reader/player.  This means things like: providing the means to resolve conflicts, either internal or external ones.   Let’s call it constructing a melodic line and a harmonic progression that resolves on the dominant tonic.  
In other words, surprises are great, but ridiculous endings or resolutions are just annoying and dis-satisfying. 

	* Seek to embody themes that will really resonate with audience/s.  Provide characters that appeal to multiple demographics, identities, worlds, and especially to a (vaguely) “proletarianized” class of player-reader who are looking for “impossible” answers to real questions/problems. (See Thematic Tones:Themes)  Provide some kind of hope for a new kind of solution to intractable contradictions.  Offer glimpses into philosophy that are not simply banal blandishments. Don’t just reconfirm pre-conceived notions/ideology.

	* Offer rewards in the shape of creative work, such as musical compositions, unique communities/families of characters, interesting player and non-player characters, and perhaps a degree of civilization building albeit on a smaller scale and within the context of my “Enclosures”. This latter would be something like the God role in games like SimCity, Cities Skylines, The Universim, Trainz,… or even Minecraft I guess, but with a more specific palette.
Another take on the shape of creative work is the Bogdanovian / Proletkult one. In other words, the creative work should not be stashed away in a museum and produced only by workers in the art industry, but should be performed on the street and produced by the masses. (By the way, is YouTube a museum or a street? Hmmm…) 

	* At one extreme, have a strong creative element in a multi-player interaction might appeal to introverts.  In other words, songs, villages, communities, inns, tunes, tools, meals, arguments that are created and published or released might flow into the mix available to other players.  But they do not necessarily require direct interaction with other players. 
A kind of socially-distanced game play I guess?  
Reward is in creating and seeing adoption stats, seeing one’s scenarios performed by, one’s tools used by others…


As far as direct rewards within the gaming model, some of the interesting points that Sylvester makes are…

The anticipation of rewards, as opposed to the actual reward itself, is what creates the dopamine reaction (i.e., the motivation to play, to continue to play).  In writing, this would be something like foreshadowing or creating conflicts that call out for resolution or laying out the mystery.  This in itself is not enough. In itself does not spark joy.
In gaming, creating such anticipation without actual reward means people will stop playing.  Good skill and crafting not only provides rewards in a meaningful emotional context (as noted above) but provide the reward reinforcement on a schedule that is enjoyable and fruitful in the player-reader’s world.
In writing, this would be keeping a good pace of posing mystery/contradiction/conflict and resolving it, as well as continuing character development.

The reward reinforcement schedule might have a…

Fixed ratio:  each such-and-such action always results in such-and-such a reward.  This simple version of this is the most banal drug addict, click the cow kind of interface.   
Variable ratio:  the reward occurs in a randomized fashion. More like gambling.  The player keeps clicking the cow in anticipation of hitting it.  This may be a sliding scale kind of thing, where newer, less experience players are rewarded more often for a particular behavior, but older, more experienced players get that reward on an increasing random schedule.  And of course, escalating the difficulty of the tasks is a common variation too.
Fixed interval.   The reward occurs only the nth time the behavior occurs (rather like the little goodies in Waze).  These are generally poor motivators for on-going play, sparking short-term interest only.  
Variable interval.  The reward occurs after the behavior occurs random times.  Like playing craps.  It’s exciting because you never know when you might hit it.  However, there is lower overall chance of a win on any given try, so players may become de-motivated in the short term, less likely to  quickly repeat the behavior.
Differential reinforcement of low response rates:  like fixed interval but with a throttle against trying to gain the reward too early. Encourages steady but low rate of activity.  
Differential reinforcement of high response rates:  behavior must occur n times within a time frame to get the reward.
There are many other possible schedules, with varying motivation responses elicited. 

Sylvester’s basic recommendation is to engineer multiple superimposed reinforcement schedules, giving the example of Civilization V, where there are as many as 30 different reinforcement schedules going on at any given time. (No wonder I like it so much! :-) ) 
This is what gives that extremely successful game its “oh, let’s play just one more turn” feeling.   There is always something that may provide a reward type of feedback on every click, but seldom always the same combination of things. Some occur quickly, regularly.  Some seldom.  Some within a certain time frame.
It would not hurt to think of this kind of superimposed, variable-length phrasing when designing scenarios in writing too (and music for that matter).

The ne plus ultra according to Sylvester is an emergent reinforcement schedule.   This is when the reward emerges from the nature and style of game play itself.  Chess is the classic example.  
The pace of reward (taking the opponents pieces) is determined entirely by the strategy deployed by the player.  This can be a very boring approach too — a death-match killer game is dominated by someone with the killer joystick or whatever, who can kill more cows than anyone else.  But there is little flexibility or interest other than hitting the top of the leader board.  


  The other interesting thing that Sylvester outlines about motivation has to do with extrinsic vs intrinsic motivations.   
This is where it gets interesting. Ask when providing a reward demotivates the player-reader.  The basic finding is that when players/participants are involved in something they perceive as a creative or social activity, offering rewards at all is demotivating. They come to associate the activity more narrowly (“I only play the piano to satisfy the demands of my teacher”) rather than approaching it joyfully and experimentally (“Playing the piano is fun! Look what cool things I figured out to do with notes and chords based on the A minor natural scale!”).
The trick is to find the most joyful, interesting balance between extrinsic and intrinsic motivations, using a complex reinforcement schedule and, ideally, crafting an instrument that encourages emergent responses.   



  Try to specify game actions and/or story twists that might address the kind of motivational reward patterns noted above.

            <Title>Saskantinon</Title>
            <Text>The Enclosure, a geographic region worked by the Agency in an attempt to revive life on Gavor, encompasses all of Saskantinon, Aranzen, Ilyusahn, Forgh, the Krunkinotto, most of Komilkol, much of Wesshewen, the Krbsh Sea, the Bay of Bar and the Aran Sea. On the outskirts of the Krbsh Sea, the island group called The Remari is also within the Enclosure.

Some land and ocean geography beyond the noted areas are also inside of the Enclosure. Beyond the Enclosure there is less life and more natural devastation, including some "blasted zones". 

The Enclosure itself helps to maintain a suitable level of ozone protection within it. Beyond the Enclosure, temperatures are higher and in some ares UV exposure can be very damaging. Severe storms and weather events are more severe outside the enclosed zone.

The world-ocean on the planet Gavor covers more area than on Earth due to the melting of its ice caps as part of the Catastrophe. Ancient urban zones are mostly buried deep underwater at the time of the story-telling.

The Agency is working on plans to trigger large volcanic eruptions and other large-scale engineering feats in the hopes of accelerating the return of an ice age.  

Gavor and Lurabar maps need to reflect more clearly the boundaries of the Enclosure. 

“Wing Island” is one of the Remari Islands. They lie to the east of Saskantinon, just beyond the Krbsh Sea, to the southeast of Forgh. 

There is the possibility to encounter life-forms and even civilizations of sort who survived the Catastrophe without the assistance of the Agency. The throwback to pre-industrial times should be much more severe in those cases.


Continue to work on names for things that are fun, non-derivative, unique if possible and not offensive in real languages.  While investing too much effort in the in-game languages would be a huge time sink, some attention to the quality of words, place names, proper names and so on the major languages would be nice to have.


Cape Cod, the Mass. Islands, Long Island and Block Island are called “The Outer Lands” by geologists in real life. I love that term. Since I want to re-model / re-factor at some aspects of the eastern provinces of Saskantinon after this area. To start with, stealing the term “The Outer Lands”. Sounds cool, fits their role in the story/setting, and creates a cultural bond between the [Blu Flat/Pavanarune and Eibar areas within the Fatunika to Mobalbesq, the eastern Kahila Lands, the Nye Lands and Arq].


Reading the Bill Moyer interview with Joseph Campbell, he went into some detail about the mythical significance of the numbers 13 and 9. Twelve, of course, fits my narrative in a (chromatic) musical sense, along with various harmonic combinations. Even if such numerological combos are not an overt part of the story, it might be helpful to use such patterns when constructing relationships between towns, regions, neighborhoods and so on. The musical structures described in Loy's Musimathics and in Mathieu's Harmonic Experience could also be fun to play with. </Text>

            <Text>ACT I - Summary 2

These Act-level summaries were written before the beat sheet was developed. Consider them as a draft to be played with.
===

Act One — The Land Between Two Rivers

Consider titling chapters or sections with the names of a song, song cycle or snippets from a song from the region covered in that section, or relevant to the action.  

B'arqo tours the Inns of the eastern towns, distributing songs he has gathered, chasing contacts related to his information gathering work.

At the Inn of the Full Moons in Ríkila. B'arqo arrives. A classic opening bar scene. A wise old grandfather character, B'arqo is a story-teller, a narrator whose conversations, tales and songs frame the epic. And he’s a bit of a wizard. His surprise is information. Good information should always be a surprise.

[Ed. - Be careful to avoid too much explanation, description. Get to the main characters and main action. Consider interspersing B'araalod's work throughout.]

The Ríkila narration leads into... 

Chapter 1 proper, the  Rich Tall Tales of Iohane and Henqu, which gives us a rapid tour of the Ring. 

Telling the tales of the Ring leads into a detour, of sorts, in Chapter 2, Northward to Sorrow.

B'arqo and others make their way to Selaron for an auction. Held following arrival of large trading and fishing vessel working the Krbsh Sea, as well as trade delegations from the southern provinces.  Touring the pleasant lands of Free Mobalbesq and setting up camp in Selaron, a number of characters emerge who will play a bigger role in Act Two.  

B'arqo’s narration from Selaron leads into the unfolding of 3 inter-related books:

Chapter 3 - Holidays Among the Kahilafolk.

Chapter 4 - The Delicious Legends of Massachawa.

Chapter 5 - The Great Auction.


After the auction, B'arqo takes his tour to Morilly, which is on the road to Byenung. The company includes Showan on his way home for a Big Argument, and also SPQ, on his way home to Nye Lands with newly acquired materials for his laboratory. 

In Morilly, we meet Maatsuuv and some of her militants, which provides the basis for most of… 

Chapter  6 - Into the Nye. 

and

Chapter 7 - The Splendid Boys of the Mobalbesq. 

The final interlude.

In the final installment of the frame-work story, the action coalesces back into real time.

All of our stories so far meld at the events in Selaron, in Morilly, and in the dispersal of our characters on the roads to the west and the south. 

We’ve developed high hopes about a green future, then had a sad when we realize there’s no birds or bees.

We get annoyed about the treatment of Allane. 
We begin to realize there might be something weird going on with the Jaxen. 

There is a love triangle. Showan’s love for SPQ is unrequited, as is Stanley’s for Birakay. This is echoed with SPQ, Remanj Jexan and ...
Happy confusion should result from the multiple levels of gender and romantic play.

Get some enthusiastic good news. 
 Iohane and Henqu, have traveled east not only on a Rider mission, but a personal one as well.  They intend to rescue Kaharan and Allane, despite the issues this will raise with the Authority.

Set up for the arrest of the Riders.


There are still some tales to tell.  

This time B'arqo is listening and gathering, not telling. 



This is where we hear directly from the folks who’ve stories we’ve heard second-hand so far.


Chapter 8 - Blessed Flames

Roís is a refugee who tells a frightening story about barbarians and machines.  

Qu’rub is a Fatunik youth who admires the Riders and longs for a better life. 

Word arrives that Allane has escaped on her own and is headed for Low Weir. Maatsuuv cautions that Dauni Vakasaqua discipline can be almost as harsh as the Heliops, in its own way.  

Rollo and Remanj explain why they are preparing for war and describe the ominous shadows forming over the Ilyushan Mountains. 

As the parties begin to depart Morilly, the Dorq Tagabant descends, seizing several Untamed and Bu’ruq. Shockingly, they take away Iohane and Henqu as well, and announce their candidacy for cleansing at the upcoming Gleaming in Beshquohuk.  

B'arqo abruptly ends his tour. 

Instead of going on to Nye Lands, Byenung and a visit home to Barqton, he makes plans instead to head to Juuj and then Beshquohuk via the Kahilakol forest.

            <Title>Ramona</Title>
            <Text>Ramona
71 • Mixry, Selaron, elsewhere

Role in Story
An ode to ethno-musicologists of all times and places.  (Including Thelma Adamson, Franz Boas, Zora Neale Hurston and others.)  Her story involves doing things that women aren't expected to, exceeding at them, being pushed out because of it, having a long-distance marriage, a love affair, an illness, an unjust sequestration. 

Describe the "town" of Mixry. (May want to change the name. That is still perhaps a bit too obvious?) 
Goal
To escape sequestration at Mixry and resume her field work.

Physical Description
A huum who is interested in all the songs of the Lands, especially those that are the oldest, among communities who predate the arrival of Heliops and Riders.

Personality
Smart, literate, independent.

Occupation
Musicologist — an anthro- or other-species-knowledge-gatherer who focuses on the musical heritage of the group being understood. She runs a Finders group called the "Mobali Song Catchers".  

A member of the Traveling Sisters of the Way of All Things and, like Stan and Showan, has studied at the Academy at Terpinol.  Due to her extensive travels and connections, she is familiar with many languages, styles and cultures. Is very good at blending in. A close friend of B'arqo.

She uses no honorific and is thus known as "Ramona'aarql", which means basically "Ramona from Arq"

Habits/Mannerisms
Quiet, keeps to herself. Finds ways to acquire reading materials through a network of contacts inside and outside of the Fatunik bureaucracy.  Not sure if her partner is still living (he is not) and knows where she is (he does not, but keeps looking for her). 

Background
Was taken by the Dorq Tagabant when they observed her living with Terrapinas for an extended period of time and recording their long, slow songs and creation stories. 

Internal Conflicts
Sadness at separation from family and lovers. Sadness at inability to continue her work. Maintaining a positive attitude while being unfairly sequestered.

External Conflicts
Ended up on the wrong end of a Fatunik investigation, she was judged a threat to good order, but not severe enough to merit correction during the Burning Days. 

Story-lines
All of that ^ is background. She is the adopted daughter of Mikel Moballeq. Stanley P. Quinn is her adoptive brother. Like Stan, she was brought up from Arq at a young age by B'arqo.

            <Title>Birakay</Title>
            <Text>Birakay
21 seasons • Qurol

Role in Story
Birakay is an entertainer. A professional court jester. An example of being pulled from the Sunny Side to the Dark Side.

The Fool. The Lover. The Wood-Nymph. The Succubus. 
Also a narrator, like B'arqo and Waleran. The Muses. Also a key character. The Old God who converts to the New Song.

Goal
Birakay seeks to bring deeper perspective and understanding into the role of Bards and of song and music generally in the Saskan Lands.
He also provides some balance to some of the heavy themes in story. 

Physical Description
Fashionable. Hot. Lots of sex appeal. Often has a broad grin or smile. Maintains Fatunik gender-neutral norms when under the Watch. Birakay is neither partnered nor holder of any official position of authority,. Appearance and presentation geared to distinctly bad boy male, but not in a macho fashion. Think River Phoenix or James Dean around age 20.  Maybe Keanu Reeves.

Personality
The most popular Bard in the Saskan Lands. A rock star. Sings beautifully. Knows all the songs. Performs well in ensembles as well as solo.   

Occupation
Since the Bards Guild is officially sanctioned in the Heliop provinces, his membership in it is an open secret, publicly denied. His official job is with the River Watch at the docks of Qurol. Responsibilities there are murky. Consist mainly of greeting visitors along the river and the Ring. Qurol is the most free-wheeling of the Fatunik towns. It's the only one where the Fatunik Representative presents as female. Birakay’s most raucous performances are at the great brothel house of Qurol.  Officially he is like a model working for the tourist board of Qurol. 

Habits/Mannerisms
Public persona is carefully crafted. Enjoys celebrity status. But Birakay is a serious musician.  A defender of and advocate for bards, players, actors and poets despite constraints of Fatunik culture and law. Spends time working on writing and composing fresh material for popular consumption, while other works remain hidden or performed only outside of the Fatunik provinces. In public he is outgoing, brash, and flirts with everyone.  In person he is kind and considerate, abhors violence and prejudice. Romatically is exclusively gay. Believes that radical social changes are needed in the Saskan Lands. Would like to see the old rivalries ended. Is worried about survival.

Background
Raised in a Qurol brooder house. The natural child of a local innkeeper and an itinerant Ring Rider. Birakay exhibited musical talent early in life. He was lucky enough to have been noticed at an early age by the mage B'arqo, who used his back-channel influences to see to it that the boy was trained by local bards who perform sub-rosa in the back streets of Qurol. He was drafted into the River Watch, as are many Qurol youths. Once stationed in the barracks of the River Tagabant, he soon began to express male gender and explore homosexuality in an open way. The latter is not unusual in the Saskan Lands — whereas the open expression of male gender at such a young age was definitely considered rebellious. This might have caused some trouble for him if he lived in a different town and hadn’t soon become a local celebrity due to his extraordinary musical performances, which was directed into his role as a kind of spokesperson/advertiser for Qurol businesses.

During a sub-rosa Bard’s tour of the Eastern Ring, ostensibly as part of a Qurolan trade mission, Birakay encountered Azron Gurk, who tagged him to make it easier for the Agency to track his movements and provide monitoring, and SPQ, who both scanned him and caught his eye. In a brief conversation, SPQ described an idea for projecting dreams of Birakay for folks to enjoy even when Birakay was not present in person.  It was so weird, Birakay just laughed, but now can’t get the idea out of his head and thinks of SPQ often.
   
Internal Conflicts
Has not overcome his Fatunik ideological training.  Has anxieties that his male expression and his embrace of new songs will contribute to the Re-emergence of the Catastrophe.  Is drawn towards resistance forces amongst the Settany and the Kahila, the star-gazers and so on, particularly when they offer alternative views on gender expression and new music. 

Travels a lot. Is famous everywhere. Birakay faces the common problems in this line of work:  exhaustion; many temptations regarding intoxicating substances and sexual misconduct; stunted emotional growth due to narcissism and ego-sickness; feeling of lack of authenticity.  Birakay is not particularly well-compensated for his work. despite the admiration of many fans, he is the target of frequent criticisms from the Fatunik Authority.

His life mirrors that of popular Russian rockers during the late Soviet era, when rock music was officially disdained but tolerated and widely enjoyed by young people.

His involvements with the Bards and other Lunik undertakings has drawn the attention of the Dorq Tagabant. He is warned by both friends and foes to watch his back.  An opportunity to take on the role of the mythical Irate Monarch and to become the Pilot of the Chrome Ark in an epic performance of The Dance of the Antelopes staged by the Bards Guild of Mabhakol forces him to finally choose sides.  (See the “Story of the Hill People’s Dance”).

He gets involved in the Circle of Fives founded by Monmar Massachawa and ends up providing cover for a plot that involved the kidnapping of a member of the High Council of the Heliocastron, the impersonation of the same at the annual Burning Days in Beshquohuk, where a hilariously revolutionary speech is delivered, and the release of the official into the Ríkila Bazaar. This plot was considered to be part of what led up to the Event in Ríkila. Although Birakay’s role in it was never made public, suspicions abounded and he has been assigned for Correction by the Dorq Tagabant and is being monitored by the Specials.  

Read the piece on “Death of the Hero” in Jung’s “Red Book”.  Birakay seems like he will be our murdered hero/assassinated god, but instead it is Showan Nywing -- who betrays him -- then saves him -- then dies.

This will happen at a turning point in the epic, when it is starting to become evident that the tide is turning against the Old Heliops. About half-way through Act 3, at the height of the purge of rebels.  We’ll have a Volunteer — Kam possibly — get recruited to do the deed. There will be a torrential downpour in the wake of the assassination — where there has been drought and threat of famine up to that point. 

The new song of Birakay will redouble its effect, bringing redemption in its wake. I don’t want him to be a christ-like figure. If anybody, that is SPQ, and its more like the return of Hosein and Jesus anyway. Birakay is the best, most virile, most genuine, most traditional representation of Fatunik culture. He is Siegfried — with several twists thrown in of course.  Notably -- that he is redeemed, re-born and re-married.

His Brunhilde is Showan Nywing, who, by proxy represents SPQ, the new god of science and rationality.  It's all very queer indeed.

            <Title>Barq Rob-Eye</Title>
            <Text>Barq Rob-Eye
Age • Skatterling, in Arq, emigrated to Eelan

Role in Story
Let's re-purpose this character. OK if I still want him to originate from Arq and have a canine blend, but he needs to be Eelani through and through. A leader, a known character in Eelan Town. Perhaps an empresario of sorts. 

The Eelani are not a tribal clan in the usual sense, like in Mobalbes, the Nye Lands and Byenung. They are diverse mountain people who came to hills to work in the mines from all parts of the Saskan Lands. This created an open, egalitarian society with few centralized authorities. The mines are run by the syndicates (guilds) of workers who work in them, with profits shared out according to seniority and difficulty of tasks. More cooperative than many of the other guilds, and run democratically.

Barq is reputed to have been run out of Arq for having "the rob-eye". (See Personality below). He wears visors or hats with a large brim and seldom looks people in the eye.

He is widely loved for his friendliness and sense of fair play and has developed a reputation as a fair arbiter for disputes. 

Goal


Physical Description
Another canine-ish character, like B'arqo, but with a shadier reputation.

Personality
It is said that you musn't look this member of the Barq clan in the eye, or, depending on the story, something -- your soul, your vision or other facility, your wallet, your lover, etc.. -- will soon go missing.

Card Number: 29
+ / -  Main conflicts in this scene.


Spillover of the eastern mobilizations into the southern lands. Debates between the leading sisters of the Dauni Vakasaqua. 

The Dauni Vakasaqua, in the form of a rare direct Appeal from Maalborra, announce that they reject calls for violent rebellion against the Heliops. This is read as an endorsement of the Mobalbesq strategy, though it does not explicitly call for fighting against the Ilyushan. They support the widespread singing of the New Songs and strongly agree with other southern factions that protecting the pollinators is key.  

They also announce a somewhat cryptic statement encouraging folks to show mercy towards the Jaxen.  They send secret word to trusted allies regarding the events among the Jaxen, encouraging them to support the dissenters.

&gt; &lt;  Main events, resolutions, actions in this scene.

With support also from the Academy and the Traveling Sisters, Malavorra'a Appeal is distributed widely. It strongly endorses and promotes the principles of Stanley's and Showan's Arguments. In the eastern regions where DV influence is less strong, especially in Arq, some southerners head north to join the fight despite the Appeal.  In many areas, supplies are gathered, in others, various types of weapons and armor; in still others, hospitals are provisioned.

Returning to the debates amongst the Kahila in card 28...

Radical Kahilabequa leaders receive many appeals for revenge, for taking advantage of the extraordinary times to reclaim the Kahila Corridor, to make the Heliops suffer as the Kahila have suffered, sack towns and outposts in Tabloonque, and so on. 

However, those who see the wisdom of Malavorra's Appeal and decide to heed, to an extent, the wisdom of the Jexan Mother.  They still raise the peaceful return of the corridor into Kahila control as a demand.

Finish --&gt; The bee hive jars are broken open in several places throughout the southern lands. [Earlier, show how the distribution of the jars was made a high priority.] The first swarms spread out. Caterpillars are also released in multiple locations.

 Timeline

Continuing from Cards 28 &amp; 30, picking it up at various points, just like in card 28 we picked up from a number of earlier points in the story arc. As with cards 28 and 29, touch on minor characters, with a focus on the southernmost and easternmost of the southern lands.    
Beauty

Have one of the very still, non-human sentients ponder the significance of the caterpillars.
Humor

In all of this, work in some scandal, intrigue, law-breaking, and general muckraking. Bribed gardai. Grisly murders. Stolen goods. Starving, poverty-stricken Afflicted who adopt the Ilyushan as their heroes and would just as soon see the whole place burn. Oh. And of course, a few more mechanical bugs.  This sort of counterpoint to the elegiac nature of Malavorra's Appeal can flow into card 30, where all hell breaks loose.
Truth

Peaceful protests work. sometimes.  Show how courage spreads into the Fatunik provinces from the Byenung and so forth, especially among the western Kahila, who move peacefully to occupy the corridor.  
Impact

Sword of Damocles. Lohrn learns of the peaceful occupation of the Kahila Corridor and sends a kill squad to stop it.

            <Text>Snek
Unknown • Gets around quite a bit

Role in Story
Snek likes to make jokes about most things. Has an ear to ground, you might say. (LOL!)

Goal
To open the door to a totally different perspective.  To help the huum and sints help themselves.  To prevent egregious errors. To point the way towards big solutions.
Physical Description
A highly conscious snake, whose line of descent precedes arrival of huum in the area. Enhanced consciousness due to yet another Agency intervention gone awry. 

Snek knows things.
Personality
Spends almost all of its time sitting still, contemplating, occasionally eating something. 

Occupation
Who knows. Snek voluntarily stows away on the pollinators vessel, then redirects them to Wing Island, where they find the Jars and the Key to the Jars.

Habits/Mannerisms
Thinks, speaks in Zizekian expostulations. Highly philosophical terminology and musings. 
Though Snek understands them all, Snek chooses to not speak huumish languages, 
Snek refers to Snek as Snek.

External Conflicts
May be tempted to eat some of the eggs of Cereb's offspring? Sees birds as a food source more than, or at least as much so, as a gift to help with pollination and spreading of seeds.

            <Title>Story Arc Summary</Title>
            <Text>Here is a summary of Vonnegut’s lecture on story arcs. I want to play with these in order to help bring some structure to writing the story about Saskantinon.

Some basic advice on story-telling:
	⁃	Tell a joke
	⁃	Know your goal
	⁃	Tell a truth
	⁃	Make me care — emotionally, aesthetically, intellectually

Story arcs are emotional arcs. The y-axis typically describes ill-fortune (fall) and good-fortune (rise). The x-axis is time, from begin to end of the story.

Complex and popular stories may combine the 6 basic types of narratives sequentially. For example: Harry Potter stories.  But each coherent part of the overall epic is likely to follow one of the six basic patterns.

The most popular patterns are “Man in a hole” and “Cinderella”.  Cinderella is the most popular story arc in many traditions, especially western. Examples include:  creation myths and Christian redemption tales. See image.


1. Rags to Riches.  Rise. Steady, staggered or precipitous rise from ill- to good-fortune.
2. Riches to Rags.  Fall. Steady, staggered or precipitous fall from good- to ill-fortune. 
3. Man in a Hole.  Fall, then rise.
4. Icarus. Rise, then fall. 
5. Cinderella.  Rise, fall, then rise.
6. Oedipus. Fall, rise, then fall.  

----

Also: always be clear about the Point of View. Who is telling the story? Let's try to avoid falling into omniscient observer.  Add a section on each story board card identifying PoV.

——

For Act One, I am thinking an overall Oedipus (or Daedulus) trajectory is what I am after. 

I want to introduce a number of the settings and characters — 

Multiple small falls and close-ups… B'arqo/the Mages &amp; Bards; the bazaar in Rikiki/the romperi guilds/Kahilakol/Kahila folks/ALF types; the Riders Guild/Borded/Jess and Jenn; the languages and writings/how sints can get sent up; and a bigger fall, but not a Really Big Fall:  the darker side of Fatunik justice and duty/Beet, Mixry, the gleaming — which also lets us know about the very real threats from Wesshewen, Krunkinotto and Ilyushan; 

Rise: the joy and wonder of the two rivers; the musical interplay between Sun and Moons worship, seen via travelers on the Ring and the rivers; getting to know more of the towns, with hints about others that are farther away from the Ring; a first glimpse at the port towns on the Krbsh Sea; the whole deal with the busy beavers of Byenung; the freedom of Low Weir — and the mysteries of Aranzen and other Southern realms.

Fall: end by looking out from Beshquohuk and Juuj; the day of gleaming, the passion of Jess and Jenn; rumors from the East


For Act Two, an overall Man in a Hole trajectory, with a Cinderella start.

Rise: The Kahila/romperi attempted rescue and ensuing rising from the gleaming. They are born again. 

Rise: B'arqo and crew pursue technology and alliances that will help to counteract the influence of the Heliops without weakening the huum (Riders, Heliops) so much that they will be open to attack from the North or the South. 

Falling/Rising: They encounter numerous difficulties, some losses. It starts to look like all is lost. We explore the death drive in some detail.  Then we encounter the Windward Angels / Empafarasi (not sure what I want to call them) &amp; the underground caverns, where new technology and new ideas are introduced. We get the first glimpse of what the Enclosure really consists of. 

Rise/Falling/Rising: A sea voyage takes place and we start to learn more about the rest of the world, about other evolved sentients, and get the first hints about the Agency.  This prolongs the suspense (I hope) in the sense that it repeats the fall/rise theme. The ship may be lost, but it’s not. The Sea may be full of monsters, but it’s not; it is the home of some important friends — taking us all the way back to the first scene with those onto-barmen.  We may fall off the edge of the world, or we may pass into a realm of horror/radiation, etc..  But we don’t. 

Rise: The new technology is both philosophical — not external revolution but internal evolution, not expanded consumption but expanded sharing — and technological/magical -- flight. We meet a type of creature that has been missing throughout the story so far:  birds.  (Note to self: introduce an island or two of birds somewhere out in the Krbsh Sea).  And we meet the mutants at High Weir who have some similar abilities — also perhaps levitation (introducing a magical element that can’t be easily explained) — are they holographs? Is it magnetism? Something else?  And in the underground — plans for gliders, kites, balloons, parachutes. 

Rise: We literally rise out of a hole at the end of Act Two as we see the first balloons rise and birds flying.

For Act Three, we finish with everybody’s favorite: Cinderella

Rise: The flotilla, on air and sea, makes its way towards the Northeast, while the romperi, the bards, the Byefolk and the Dauni Vakasaqua lay the groundwork for introducing change. It all looks exciting when…

Fall, fall, fall: Trouble strikes from multiple directions. An uprising of the clones is coordinated with an attack from Krunkinotto. Barbarian gangs and nomads from the Wesshewen plains take advantage to press an assault.  The outbreak of “monsters” in Ilyushan causes trouble in the Northeast and a similar outbreak in the Forgh makes waves for the seaborne. This causes political problems most of all — to be seen undermining the Riders and the Heliops at this point would not only be unpopular; it could embolden the enemies at the gate. The resistance is slowed down, put on hold in some areas, and it is betrayed.   All this happens quickly, like an adventure movie that opens up with epic car chases and gun fights.

Trouble: Resistance is redirected to assist in the “national defense”.  The Seff-led sea forces and their bird-allies redirect to drive the monsters back to the Forgh. With the Riders and Heliop Volunteers having to defend the Northeast against invading hordes, the romperi and assorted dark (Kahila) and ALF forces go to the rescue of the towns of the Northeast. Meanwhile, far from the center of things, the Empafarasi are assisted by the Aranzen (who have some magical qualities of their own) in turning back a flanking attack from the Krunkinotto to the South. The conflict in the southern hills draws in the Miners of Eelan, who become aware of the considerable advances that have occurred due to B'arqo’s machinations. They defect to the rebel side. 

Trouble: Meanwhile, a glass bead game style showdown is taking place in Juuj, as SPQ’s trial draws near its conclusion, involving the eldest advisers to the Heliocastron and the most senior learned members of the Reformed Byenung Academy of Historical and Juridical Cacography.  We become aware that incognito Agents are in attendance too. They reveal themselves to some extent in order to influence the debate, by telling “parables” about worlds that could not be rehabilitated following their Catastrophical Eras. 

Rise, but oops still falling: The Rider and Heliop forces are victorious in the Northeast. Then in an astounding betrayal, orders go out to arrest and otherwise subdue the romperi-led forces. The Fatunik Volunteers start moving en masse East to take over the battle against the monsters.  The debate in Juuj is interrupted by a team from Beshquohuk who lie so fast, so loudly, with such felicity — introducing the New Theology of Post-catastrophic Optimism — that the Juuj elders are taken in by it. When they announce the need for a New Gleaming, the The Runes of Bye philosophers begin to despair, and consider leaving. Agents begin to draw up reports downgrading the whole place. 

Rising, but still trouble: Meanwhile, the clones have been defeated in the Southwest and the monsters have retreated to the Forgh. The flotilla makes its way to the ports and prepares to defend the Kahila folk from the New Gleaming as reports begin to come in of the first massacres and so on.

Rising: As would be expected the Riders leadership refuses to participate in the New Gleaming, but does offer help in securing the Northeast. At this point they are confronted by the Miners of Eelan, who insist on a different approach and point out that a new three-or-more-sided alliance not only makes the region more secure, but that there is no assurance the combined air and sea forces of the rebels could be defeated. Furthermore, they support SPQ’s case and fear that even if the monsters are defeated, there will be an eco-collapse.

Rise: The Riders agree. Their reps go the Great Trial, along with B'arqo, and offer a new vision to the assembly. Riders go to the Northeast, disrupt attacks against the Kahila folk, and together the Riders, the next generation of forward-thinking Heliops and the assorted Kahila-folk and their allies drive back the monster hordes.

Rise: The sky-flotilla emerges. Balloons, kites, banners, gliders — and birds, bees and butterflies — are seen all over the Saskan Lands, to the astonishment and delight of all.    The agents rewrite their reports.

Coda (riches to rags, a standard monster-sci-fi ending…)

From the swamps of the Forgh, a dragon-beast arises.

Deep in the underground bunkers of the Krunkinotto, a spy-Jax returns from Saskantinon, with diagrams and blueprints of flying machines.  These are shown to a system that is developing something like rocket fuel.



Cinematic concepts that may be useful

Read Blake Snyder’s “Save the Cat” and Syd Fields “The Foundations of Screenwriting”. 

These offer good tips. Need to be mindful of whether I am writing a novel or a movie screenplay. Maybe the former with an eye towards the latter?  At any rate, some good and useful tips include:

* Jungian archetypes matter.
  * I’ve acquired most of Jung’s works. Read them!
  * I’ve also ordered the fundamental books by Joseph Campbell. Read them!
  * I found a book on Lex’s shelf by Stephen Fry which is his re-telling of Greek myths. Read it! 

* Understand who the hero is and make sure they are active and emotionally engaged.
  * Sleepy, inactive heroes are boring.
  * “Special effects” heroes are boring.
  * Be able to describe the developmental arc of the hero and other main characters.

* Be able to describe the entire plot using 4 rows of 10 cards. This is the Board. Let’s get Hegelian.
  * Row 1 = ACT ONE (thesis)
  * Row 2 = The first part of ACT TWO (antithesis)
  * Row 3 = The second part of ACT TWO (more antithesis)
  * Row 4 = ACT THREE (synthesis)

Make sure to:
  * Include excitement in the first reel = the first ten minutes.
  * Introduce most if not all main, important characters in ACT ONE
  * Introduce an interesting twist, often with a new character, in the second part of ACT TWO  
    when action make be starting to lag.
  * Start of ACT TWO with a big problem for the hero/protagonist.  It should be a big moment.
  * Introduce a new, even worse problem later in ACT TWO.
  * Master sub-text and exposition. What is left unsaid. What is implied. The subtle, wry comment.
    * These have much more impact than dry, rote exposition.
    * When describing place, setting and so on, use clues and canonical images, not one-dimensional photography.
  * Find and eliminate, smooth out black holes in the Board - a gap where nothing happens, or doesn’t fit the overall structure of the story. Look to insert “booster rockets” wherever things are getting dull.
  * Include some callbacks — a seemingly innocent, minor detail, usually in ACT ONE, that turns out to be an important plot element later on.  Can be lighthearted as well, like helping to explain a joke or catch-phrase.
  * The log-line and the poster. 
     * How do I describe the story in a brief statement?
     * What image captures its essence?
  * What is primal? Sex, survival, hunger, revenge. Without some good primal energy, unless you are producing for a European art house audience, it will be unlikely to sell.

Other Good Resources

* For thinking in terms of video game art and story telling:
Chris Solarski’s “Interactive Stories and Video Game Art” and “Drawing Basic and Video Game Art”

* Basic concepts of art, shape, shadow, light, drawing; classical forms:
  * Charles Bargue Drawing Course 
  * Visual Guide to Classical Art Theory
  * Light for Visual Artists
  * Everything by Andrew Loomis

* Design concepts, especially data and programming, but more generally too:
  * Everything by Edward Tufte
  * Everything by Christopher Alexander
  * Wilkinson, “The Grammar of Graphics”
  * Hamming, “The Art of Doing Science and Engineering”
  * Gregory, “Game Engine Architecture”
  * Shariat, “Tragic Design”
  * Spinellis, “Beautiful Architecture”
 

And Now For Something Completely Different 

Maybe an AI has scanned my notes and delivered them to Netflix? The "Witcher" backstory mini-series features a viral song spreading throughout the Empire, rousing the folk to resistance, sung by a famous warrior.  And the wizarding folk sometimes visit a place with Full Moons.

Hmmm.... What if we had, I dunno, 4 moons, 8 moons? That could generate some pretty wild and fun religio-superstituous quackery!  What if instead of being a singer, Birakay was a dancer?  (How the heck would that work?) Or something like a taiji teacher? Give it some thought.... All D&amp;D knock-offs have "bards".  Only some have "sword masters".  Everybody likes kung fu movies.... 


Notes on Point of View 

Want to try to avoid omniscient narrator. Also want to avoid changing PoV too often in too confusing a manner.  
The device of reports from Agents on the ground is one that can be used in many circumstances. It doesn't have to be only Azron Gurk. There can be others. They don't even all have to have names. This can also maybe help to develop the "play within a play" / "the gods must be crazy" aspect of the story, relating to discontent and rebellion amongst the Agents, leading eventually to their withdrawal from Gavor and its moons.

Demographic Summary

Historical Summary

When hunger stalks the Komikol, Barbarana is the first to suffer from raiders from the south. While having a large sint population and fully embracing the laid-back, live-and-let-live culture of the Southern Lands, the Barbaranni are known to be adept fighters in a guerilla style, retreating deep into burrows and redoubts when necessary and fierce in their resistance to occupiers from the south. 

Close relations with Byenung Toon and Terpinol, and through connections in Barbok, with the Empafarasi as well, means they have been able to call on some powerful friends when help is needed.  
Physical Description

A vast plain stretching from the Great Canal of Bye in the east to the fabled city-state of Terpinol in the west. The only sizable town in Barbarana is is sleepy Kurosol, which provides a gateway for interaction with the sint-dominated Komikol and a resting place for sea-faring travelers arriving from the Bay of Bar.

Barbarana is the grainhouse of the Saskan Lands, with enormous numbers of folks devoted to pollinating and caring for crops of grasses and root vegetables.

Description

The town of Hádika (or Hadakik depending on your dialect) sits on the border with Wesshewen, near the western foothills of the Ilyushan Mountains.  Its holdings are all on its southern side of the town. There is no opening in the town's walls towards the north or the east. 

The town’s only gate, to south, sits on the Mixry Road, which is the border between Norgyte and Salotriza.  

Hádika is very much a military town and part of the martial traditions and lore of both Norgyte and Salotriza, though in the popular imagination it is probably more closely associated with the Songs of Service and the Obligation of a Volunteer, a song cycle and a long solo vocal piece, respectively, honoring the Volunteers.  

It has a long history as a front-line defense against raiders from the north and monsters from the east.  The Chief of the Watch is the undisputed and leading Fatunik official here.  With its large Fatune Tagabant and two permanent barracks for Volunteers as well, there is a disciplined military aspect to most activities in the town.  The Riders have a significant military presence her, where they collaborate closely with the Fatunik militias. 

The dominant guild alliance in Hádika is The Candle-makers Craft Hall, commonly referred to in the militant anthems that tend to make up the the jaunty Bardsongs of the Northern Gate as “The Three Lights”.  Including the Fatunik Armorers and Cobblers, and the Fatunik Carpenters Guild along with the Candlemakers guild, the Hádika Craft Hall is an effective military supply organization. It produces high-end, heavy-duty metal armor such as chain- and ring-mail, all types of leathery and bony things, along with exquisite short swords and knives.  The continuous demand from both the Heliops and Borded for military equipment guarantees that such guild business thrive here. 

Hádika is not a closed town.  The  trade carried on by the Hádika Candle-makers Craft Hall is conducted with partners from all around the Ring. Hádika hosts one of the best-known and best-supplied arms bazaars in the Saskan Lands.

Type of Location

Terpinol is the only province of the Saskan Lands that might be considered to be a city-state.  The province is properly called the Terpinol Community and unlike the other much larger Southern Lands, it has a formal governance structure. 

Terpinol Toon occupies much of its land area.

The province has the smallest land-area by far of any of the provinces, encompassing only a number of villages and farms in the immediate vicinity of Terpinol Toon, most notably the village of Scatterling, where several "Free and Independent" guilds, as well as a semi-secret society called The Greens, have their headquarters.

Historical Summary

Physical Description

Terpinol Toon has two main features:

A vast complex called the Star Gazers Academy, which serves as a kind of university as well as an observatory.

A marina serving sea-farers and explorers via the Aran Sea. 

Widely respected throughout the Southern Lands, the Weir Lands and those in the Outer Lands who coalesce their efforts via the Night Hall as a source of learning and engineering, the Academy -- in some subtle ways -- provides the fourth pillar of culture in Saskantinon, balancing the more martial attitudes of Borded, Beshquohuk and High Weir with a deep commitment to critical scientific  thinking and to magical practices.

            <Title>Lohrn</Title>
            <Text>Lohrn the Carpenter
24 • Ríkila

Role in Story
Has a unique perspective on the foreign lands to the west, beyond the Weir Lands and the Krunkinotto. 

Knowledgable about the internal workings of an important Guild organization.

Let's completely change this character to become a member of Tonedo'a inner circle. I like the background of abuse and so on. But let's make him into a baddie, a real baddie -- the Bannon to Tonedo's Trump, the Goebbels to Tonedo's Hitler.  He becomes a hard core "old believer", breaking with Tonedo when Lohrn starts to believe he is not being "tough enough" with the dissidents.

Goal
Lohrn, for anyone who bothers to ask, likes to provide a commoner’s everyday view of the infamous past events in Ríkila and the current dramas unfolding in the Saskan Lands.  Someone who just wants to get thru the day without too much trouble, isn’t interested in joining any factions. 

Physical Description
Small, often dissheveled due to constant hard working and tendency towards intoxicants. Has a foreign accent reflecting his origins in the (unnamed) western lands beyond the mountains. Does not have a partner and is not in a position of authority, so sexual/gender identity remains neutral/unclear in public settings, at least when there are Tagabants about.  

Personality
Smart. Observant. Quiet.  Tends to focus on practical matters, has an engineer’s eye for things.

Occupation
Is apprenticed to a member of the Carpenter’s Council (c.f. Otto Trucent).

Habits/Mannerisms
Quiet, somewhat fearful. Occasional bouts of drunkeness or intoxication. May be an addict. Has been traumatized and is reluctant to trust anyone. Years in care of Riders/Carpenters brought about better socialization, but has not addressed deeper scars.  

Background
An orphaned refugee from the far west, beyond the Krunkinotto. Home village was ravaged by Entropics (wild bands of marauders, common in Wesshewen, but also further west, where they are even wilder), who enslaved Lohrn as a child. Escaped during a conflict with a Cloned (Jexan) outpost in the mountains, headed south eventually taking a raft downriver into Oknott. Learned to speak Eibar in Borded.  Was put into care of independent Brooders tied to the Carpenters Guild. After hearing the background story during a visit to the brood house, Otto Trucent requested Lohrn as apprentice and then had hir relocated to Ríkila.  

Internal Conflicts
Many psychological scars. Abuse by Entropics left alot of unresolved anger, which Lohrn keeps bottled up.

External Conflicts
Somewhat sympathetic towards the Jaxen due to their role in freeing Lohrn from enslavement, an attitude that is typically very unpopular in the Saskan Lands, gets Lohrn into trouble from time to time. Deepening reliance on intoxicants is drawing Lohrn into unsavory (literally) underworld connections. 

Story-lines
Lohrn's sympathy for the Jaxen struck a chord with Remanj Jexan during one of his trips to Ríkila.

            <Title>Fatunika</Title>
            <Text>THE HELIOPTICON

This is the formal collective name of the governmental and cultural institutions who control the Fatunik regions of the Saskan Lands.  It is also referred to as “The Fatunik Union”, although strictly speaking that is the name of the collective body of representatives of the various Fatunik Guilds, whereas the geo-political entity they control is “The Fatunika”.

 
It is not incorrect to characterize the Fatunika as an aspiring but not entirely successful theological-military dictatorship with important populist tendencies.  Its power is far from absolute.  Nor is its role and influence entirely dire. 

They really do protect the population – especially the huum population, but also others under their protections – of Saskantinon from external and internal threats.  Its Central Power, called the Heliocastron, rules over a relatively prosperous and secure region that is surrounded by threats. During tumultuous times, the Heliocastronic Center is perceived by many as a source of stability and protection.


Residents of the Fatunika who follow the Fatunik belief system are referred to as Heliops.  Anyone who resides or travels through the Fatunika is subject to its laws.

There are 10 loyal Fatunik provinces.

THE HELIOCASTRON

See: Organizations --&gt; Authority and Union


The Guardians of the Sun

Tagabants enforce the gaze of the Fatunika.

See Organizations --&gt; Guardians of the Sun



THE HELIOPTIC PERIPHERY

There are a few towns and regions — mainly in the Weir Lands and Eelan — where Fatunik presence is almost non-existent.

The Dorq Tagabant tends to get some grudging respect for its role in looking into things that go bump in the night. 

Nevertheless, both arms of the Watch are justifiably feared by sints, the mixt and all those who do not hold to the Fatunik faith. Judgments can be harsh and biased, especially during the Fatunik Festival days and the annual pogram-like “Days of Burning” known as “The Gleaming”. 


ENEMIES OF THE HELIOPTICON

Traditional external threats to the region tend to come from the North and Northwest, in the form of wild beasts, raiders, pirates, bands of marauders, bizarre and frightening forces emerging from the impermissible mountains, and even the occasional full-scale invasion.  From the South and South-East, animal-liberationist gangs, sometimes autonomous, sometimes in the pay of the Krbshanana alliances, pose a potential threat.  Fears that one day they will see a unified, large-scale “animal”-led army arising in the South keep many an Agent of the Sun busy and sleepless.  As will unfold during our story [once I figure out more details… :-)  ] there is a ferocious and monstrous enemy lurking in the Ilyushan Mountains to the Northeast as well. 


Internally, the Watch tends to be concerned first and foremost with the Kahila-folk, a fairly large and enormously diverse group who mainly inhaaybet the provinces of Kahilakol and Kahilabequa, but are active in other eastern provinces too and play an important role in sea-borne trade. The Kahila tend to be non-believers. many follow or participate in a wide variety of “free”, “independent” and in a good number of cases, clearly illegal trades and guilds, up to and including organizations of assassins and hitmen, some of which are aligned with various “animal”-liberationist militants. 


In a few towns, particularly in the Kahila regions and most notably in the large town of Ríkila, the towns are divided into “Sunny” and “Moony” districts.  Relations between the two camps within these towns are tense.  



RIVALS OF THE HELIOPTICON

Of the larger Ring towns, four of them – Borded, Juuj, Byenung and Ríkila – along with several smaller towns and a wide variety of villages, some remote, some not so far from the Ring, do not recognize the Heliocrastron's right to rule over them.   In Ríkila, this is disputed — in other words, the Central Offices assert Watchful Rights but reality on the ground is different. 

Borded

In the case of the large and well-to-do town of Borded, a contract was established long ago between the Free Hostelries Cooperative, an important conglomerate of guilds led by the Riders Council, who built and run the town, and the Fatunik Union, who are permitted to operate there with restrictions.  The Riders Council runs a military organization that provides protection services, paid for mainly (but not exclusively) by the Heliocastronic Offices, throughout the Fatunika and especially on the Ring Road and along the Pavan River. Like the Fatunik Union, the Riders Council is dominated by huum (is beklek).  

The two powerful huum-run groups have a workable relationship with long historic ties. Not a small number of Riders hold to the Fatunik faith.  In their stronghold of Borded, the Riders maintain strict autonomy from the Heliops in matters of military organization, in business, in guild affairs and they have a distinct culture.

Juuj

Well inside the Ring, surrounded by deep forest, lies the ancient town of Juuj.  Bardsongs of ancient Juuj are among the best-known in the region.  Juuj-legend songs are sung in nearly every village and town of Saskantinon.  While many of the Juuj bardsongs are fanciful, the sheer number of such ballads and ditties reflects the place that Juuj holds in the imagination of the entire region.  It is far and away the oldest of the towns of the Fatunika, a fact that is obvious from its strange and tumble-down architecture.  Its old iconic structures, many still showing evidence of building materials of unknown manufacture or origin, predate, possibly by many centuries, possibly even millenia, those of the other towns in the region. 

A quiet, almost mystical place, the Heliocastronic Representative to Juuj is always careful to acknowledge the precedence of the quasi-mystical Order of the Ancient Elders of Juuj in town affairs.  Juuj Toon is almost entirely populated by the faithful, but this is most often a polite cover over much more ancient beliefs having to do with respect for the Order of Elders.

Juuj was at one time the location of the Central Office, which was later moved to Beshquohuk. The theological aspects of that move lie at the center of “modern” Fatunik argument.


Ríkila

Whereas the situations in Borded and Juuj are fairly clear-cut, Ríkila is another story altogether.  There the Heliocastronic Offices have been engaged in a state of constant civil strife with the local Lunik forces ever since the ceasefire that ended the Event in Ríkila.  The town sits astride the Ring, mid-way between the rivers and connected by a smaller road to the Krbsh Sea.  

Ríkila is an important entrepôt for trade and travel between the Fatunika and the populous sentient-dominated Lands to the east – the barely-civilized Owshk-speaking region of Ilyushan – and to the south – the powerful Grummik-speaking alliance of the Krbshanana.  Furthermore, all factions, religions, secret societies, banned guilds and malcontents of every description have a guild hall of some sort, often not amounting to more than a seedy pub or disreputable temple, in Ríkila.  It is – some say literally – where worlds collide. 

The town is literally split in two, with one half under the watchful if somewhat paranoid and draconian rule of the local branches of Tagabants and the other basically a chaotic and anarchistic bazaar where Arqq is often spoken openly and without fear.


Byenung

The town of Byenung, located on the southern Ring and spanning the River Setta, likewise refuses to officially acknowledge the rights and privileges of the Heliocastron.  In this case, the majority population – primarily a large, vivacious community of beaver/huum mixt who built much of the town – dominate business and politics in the town and also control much of the traffic on the river.  

It is suspected by some that the Byerunics, whose Toon Council officially espouse equality between huum, mixten and sints and does not militantly promote anti-huum politics, are actually  heavily influenced by mountain-dwelling, mixt who inhaaybet the Aranzen mountains far to the west of Byenung.  In other words, they are under suspicion by the Fatunik Union (and some members of the Riders Council, too) as being something of a fifth-column for “mutant” Aranzenian influence, rather than simply as a front animal-liberationist sints per se.  Unlike Ríkila with its frequent rounds of protests and street brawls, occasional uprisings, and its noisy bazaar and an infamously bawdy night life, Byenung is relatively peaceful, conservative and hard-working.

Furthermore, the Toon is the center of a large prosperous region, called The Runes of Bye, that includes the largest inland sea in the region: Great Lake of Bye. The Byerunics dominate trade and transport on both rivers and play an important role in sea-faring trade as well.

The Byenung Toon Council considers itself the proper authority in Byenung.  Its leading citizens tend to align themselves with the Night Hall, a guild co-operative that is outright banned in many parts of the Fatunika.  While most Byerunics and the The Fair Wind, as the Night Hall is referred to locally, do not openly oppose the presence of the Fatunik Union in Byenung, polite protests against and even occasional boycotts of Fatunik Scribes and Innkeepers erupt from time to time, usually organized by fly-by-night groups with verbose names like The Byenung Youth March for Equality and Justice and such.    

Byerunics are famously argumentative and verbose. They have an extremely complex and litigious society from a legal perspective.

            <Title>Ch 18 - Summary</Title>
            <Text>The story-line resolves back into real time in this chapter after a kaleidoscope view of short adventures around the outer, souther, western lands and on the border with Ilyushan: 

	•	In Terpinol, the Academy is meeting to review agents reports and take next steps
	•	A ship from Aranzen is docked at Terpinol. Foreign wizards are attending the conference.
	•	At the port in Barqton, a ship has been spotted in the Bay of Bar heading towards the Great Canal, flying the colors of the Komikol. 
	•	Small flying creatures have been spotted among the irrigated vegas and weirs of the southern Weir Lands. Some think it is proof of SPQ's conjectures; others think it is a Jaxen ploy.
	•	Members of the Old Mill Co-op discover vast underground caverns, with water flowing underground
	•	They stumble upon an Empafarasi hanger for balloons and blimps
	•	They encounter a confusing situation with what seems to be a breakaway, refugee pod of Jaxen, all named Remanj, who warn of an impending Jaxen assault on the Empafarasi strongholds.
	•	A ship is being prepared for a long journey in the port of Selaron
	•	Two Trees is about to be overrun by monsters
	•	MM's team emerges from a long dangerous underground journey, severely shaken, in the woods outside of Beshquohuk, near the compound where SPQ is being held. 
	•	Word spreads like wildfire among the Untamed and the Afflicted that Malavorra (and by implication, though not in fact, the Dauni Vakasaqua) has joined with the Eelani and the Empafarasi. They flock towards the Eelani Crossing to join the Western Army.

In each vignette...

As the greater journey rolls along,  heroes and anti-heroes encounter numerous difficulties and some losses on their journeys. Each explores the dark deep pool in a unique way, but encountering similar motifs. They explore the death drive in some detail as they each pursue an impossible goal, acting as if it all makes sense, against all sensibility.

The Empafarasi and the Dauni Vakasaqua enter the picture in greater detail. Along with some of the more mysterious enclaves like the Academy at Terpinol, the Old Mill Collective, the Moballeq Tribe, and the "far south" (Barqton and the Komikol -- hinting at the origin of SPQ and Ramona in a faraway ancient land). The underground caverns of the western lands have their own shadows and pools, but this time the shadows are being openly absorbed, allowed in, conversed with, and transformation begins.

            <Title>Ch 6 - Summary</Title>
            <Text>This chapter is told entirely by folks telling tales at a gathering in Selaron. This follows after the pre-auction get-together in Morilly, as we literally follow the characters traveling to the shore, and we also follow on from the story about life among the Kahila, in which MM has intervened. 

It melds with B'arqo’s narrative, Birakay's Song, and Bu'ruq's journal, while providing new musical and mythic themes.

The Delicious Legends of Monmar Massachawa introduce the faraway Weir Lands, and provides evidence to deepen apprehension about strange things are out there in the Krunkinotto. 


A wayfaring stranger (eh? who?) tells a wild tale about Harmonies Sung in the Light of the Moons.


Monmar Massachawa is a female action hero, with a dark, troubled tone. She takes the otherness of the Kahilafolk to a whole new level, a much deeper fall in the story arc.  She swims about in the Dark Pool, thrilled to be there, without fear.  Her descriptions of swimming make it feel like flying — and we start to get  a deeper realization of the place this central myth plays in the various cultures of the Saskan Lands.

The rise, fall, rise rhythm swells as the fortunes of the Kahila are challenged by direct competition for the illicit traffic at the great auction in Morilly from Massachawas and the Fifth Circle, possibly acting on behalf of the little-understood House of the Empafarasi. (The "bitamin" are "4 of 9" mythologically speaking. Five more "tribes" have yet to emerge. There are four major "trading" families. The "5th Circle" challenges this mythology -- claiming to be the predicted "5th estate".)

[Probably want to put this before Card 29. This is really a continuation of Card 28, showing the consequences on the ground of the decisions taken in Card 28. As throughout chapter 24, this section involves mainly minor characters. May even need to introduce a few more. Should definitely try to revisit any Outerland/eastern characters who were introduced earlier.]

The Houses of Bye, the Communes of the Mobalbesq, and many of the semi-secret societies of the Kahila Lands officially renounce ties to or the ending of peace agreements with the Heliocastronic Center in Beshquohuk.
 
The Nyeland Federation as a whole stays neutral. A few militias signal their support for rebellion against the Center, but most chose to either stay home or head to the northeast in collaboration with the Fatunik Volunteers.

Arq joins the revolt by popular demand from the base communities; there is no official sort of party in Arq. 

There are many [Where? By whom? What happens?] small uprisings against Tagabant Barracks and so forth, protests and demonstrations.  

Large, if often disorganized (? Or in the case of Bye, highly organized), sets of armed (except in Bye, where the movement is mostly peaceful) and determined (except where they are conflicted) forces begins moving, some heading towards the northeast, some heading towards Juuj and Beshquohuk, a significant force of Kahila heading towards the Corridor. 

[There needs to be personalization here. What characters are involved? If it is generic "crowd action", does it need to be a separate section? Doesn't mean this can't work, but it needs better definition.]

[Also need to probably meld this card in with some of the previous two.]
&gt; &lt;  Main events, resolutions, actions in this scene.

Many Agents [who, in particular?], based mainly in Nyeland, request and begin requesting an Exit.

In a counterpoint move that surprises Mikel and other easterners, Monmar Massachawa heads west to rally against the Jaxen and the Wesshewen raiders.  

Finish --&gt; The jars are broken open in several places throughout the eastern lands. [Earlier, show how the distribution of the jars was made a high priority.] Ants dig in, start to create mounds, forage and explore. They begin driving off non-beneficial insects who are herbivores but not pollinators, including aphids and carrying off/dispersing some kinds of flower seeds.  

 Timeline

Continuing from Card 28. Showing how the decisions taken are implemented in the various Outerland provinces.     
Beauty

Two musical lines pull against each other. Then a long bass growling. The kettledrum begins to strengthen the bass with penetrating percussion. Trumpets double the bass note up high. Off to a brilliant start.
Humor

Synchronicity reaches absurd levels sometimes. At Giltraq's hovel behind the Inn, the Hand of Kahila leaves a call-up card for me and that night he dreams of seeing his own hand. In that dream he also dreams of meeting new friends, adorned with light, and 2 new friends appear the next day, huum servers hired by the innkeepers to make up for the missing Jaxen. They claim, with witty smiles, as if waiting to see if he gets the joke, to have been sent there by the Jexan Mother. While pondering that dream, a wandering bard drifts through the bazaar singing "The Song of Dreams". One of the new friends invites him to join them for a hike to collect wild herbs. While walking in the woods, the Jexan sisters are illuminated by a sunbeam.  They dance and cavort by a pond, then swim, then embrace. 
Truth

Violent protests work. Sometimes.  Show how courage spreads among the Kahila when the eastern gangs chase the Tagabant out of parts of the Corridor.

Impact

Violence begets violence; chaos beget chaos. Lohrn's kill squads turn their attention towards the eastern part of the Corridor, reinforcing their units with frightened and outraged Volunteers. The Ilyushan, who are being directed/influenced in part by Bud Starga, celebrate the conflicts amongst the Saskans.

            <Text>Petra Bearbek, Peter Bucket, Petra Bearbek
18 • a wanderer and adventurer

Role in Story
A foil to the Henqu/Iohane story-line.

Someone who's native intelligence and curiosity reveals the doors into various secrets and occulted social settings, especially those underpinning the Dauni Vakasaqua social-cultural-spiritual-political-scientific milieu.

Similar to Kam, but on the Southern side.  A Trickster character.
Goal
A trans person in the Saskan context faces quite different challenges as compared to our world. Petra Bearbek is a strong, young female-gendered character lead who does not have to be a warrior princess type to be interesting.

Physical Description
At age 12, PB's strength of mind was calibrated at 18 MMU's (very high) using the MHUP's eye stain test and intelligence rated at 20 using the RISC criteria.

At age 14, Petra Bearbek was physically transformed, at her own request, from a boybek to a girlbek, a transformation achieved by an illusionary of the White Hand (MTGAPU).

100% bek with genius-level intelligence, after the transformation, Petra Bearbek chose the name "Bearbek" to purposely throw some confusion into the mix regarding her DNA mix. In fact, she has no ursuline DNA at all, though she does have some features of, and tends to accentuate in her clothing, the appearance of a fluffy black-and-white bear.

About 4 feet tall with jet-black hair and deep-set blue eyes.  Usually carries several concealed daggers. Is adept with a range of sling-shot style weapons.  
Personality
Has a great deal of natural charm.  

Occupation
Adept at languages. Speaks, reads and writes nearly all of the Saskan languages. Has traveled extensively.  Sometimes works as a translator or scribe's assistant (like an editor). 

Helps various Byenung legal and argumentative organizations, as well as some Untamed and Kahila rebel groups to produce propaganda. Stays informed regarding official Fatunik, Mobalbi and Rider proclamations and arguments. 

An excellent mapmaker, researcher, designer and engineer.  A natural ally of SPQ. Petra Bearbek has worked with weir builders and mining companies to improve their structures.  She likes to promote the Empafarasi innovation of wind-catchers (wind mills) in the lowlands as a way to improve/automate irrigation and grinding systems, but it is has not caught on very widely and has earned her a reputation as an Eelani sympathizer. 

Has been ordained as a professor of the highest unitary principles by the MHUP. 

All quite extraordinary for someone of PB's age and standing.
Habits/Mannerisms
Flirtatious, a bit of a "Lolita" character with something of a bad reputation on that score. 

Likes everything to do with bears.  Although not a vegetarian, very sympathetic to Fons and such, opposes cruel treatment of non-sints.

Background
Scanner Detecting Agency of Pavanarune has recorded information that she participated openly in the Uprising in Ríkila, but was not effective as a street fighter and took refuge in High Weir afterwards. 

Has spent some time sea-faring, where she learned a few words of languages used in the Aranzen, the Komikol, and even Shanowa. Has a pretty good idea that the world is much larger than is typically believed. 

Internal Conflicts
An orphan, sometimes wonders who her parents were. 

External Conflicts
Tends to question everything. Doesn't believe most of what passes for truth in the Saskan Lands. Driven to keep moving, wonders if she will ever be able to settle down / rest / be still.

Notes
Currently living in a camp in the Kahilakol Forest.

            <Text>These trade organizations are not associated with any larger syndicates. 

They tend to work mainly at the local level, with varying levels of organization between locals. 

The Free Innkeepers Guild is often thought to be associated with the Night Hall, but it is more amorphous than that. Its many connections to bitamin groups make too shady of a federation for the legalists in Byenung to want to try to manage.

The Scanners Detecting Agency is like a professional association linking together folks with special powers as well as some who are just quite good at digging into mysteries.

The Kahila Exploratory Guides are a kind of front for Basherbazooki and others looking to offer protection, mercenary and guide services for expeditions going outside the borders of the Saskan Lands. Inter-linked at many levels with various bitamin groups.

The Food Slingers of the Pavan is not highly organized, but it is quite large and tends to put on fun festivals, feasts and other get-togethers. They are organized at least in part to prevent Seffs from moving into other sectors of the food-service industry.

The Agency (c.f.) is not a guild per se. It is an inter-galactic service organization devoted to rehabilitating planets devastated by disasters.  See folder on The Agency.</Text>

            <Text>Devosh
Age • Location

Role in Story
Humor, something of a Saskan take on Star Wars' Ewoks

Myth has it that some Devosh have been able to domesticate and ride Arns and thus, they are the true Empafarasi.  And there is some truth to this rumor, though the details are a closely kept secret among the Devosh.

They play a role in one of the great battles against the monstrous Ilyushan hordes.
Goal


Physical Description
Very hairy, short people with tails.  Like the Sleeths and Arns, they are related to an extraterrestial species brought to the planet as part of the Zeldan Ascendency's attempt to reform the Agency.   (Several millienia ago, by Sakan reckoning.)

Personality
Cute and friendly to strangers.  Not as retiring as Sleeths, though still fairly stand-offish. But dangerous if challenged; they are adept with a good collection of locally-made weapons.  

They speak a pidgin of the old Devo language, Ooober and various sounds adapted from the natural environment. Some have learned to speak "proper" Bar for the purpose of negotiations and trade.  

Occupation


Habits/Mannerisms
Live only in remote areas, preferring forests and mining communities. Never go into towns.  They mainly live in cleverly-camouflaged underground burrows, but also sometimes in tree houses.

Background
In the case of the Devos, their ancestors were rescued from extermination on their home planet, which was suffering from planet-death brought on by ecological and civilizational collapse.  They were brought here millennia before the Heliops and Riders arrives in Saskantinon and settled peaceably in the country side, unobserved by most huum.

            <Text>Grim Malek
Probably about 14 • Nye Lands

Role in Story
A little bad-guy flavor attaches to Grim Malek. Likes to tell, well, grim tales of the Nye Lands. Has a weirdling nature.   

Goal
To help engineer supply of the Krbsh Expedition going out, and tracking its arrival, surreptitiously abetting the mission once it returns to land.

Physical Description
A cat-sint with distinct feline features. A somewhat snarly, snarky “bad luck” black cat.  Has a partial carapace, a sort of retractable body armor and helmet. Indeterminate gender.

Personality
Grumpy, bitey, scratchy, with a strong independent streak. A rough beauty that can’t be denied. A killer instinct. Able to fade away almost instantaneously. Very good tracker. Follows our heroes from the shadows.

Occupation
Assists their clan in import/export work. They are suppliers to traders and shippers.

Habits/Mannerisms
Much more advanced than their years might imply. A tough negotiator. Not big on small talk.  A very tough kid.

Background
Raised in one of the largest bitamin "guilds" in the Saskan Lands: the Nye Lands Free Trade Association (FTA). Grim Malek is part of a vast network that includes both licit and illicit operators.  They influence or even control much of the trade along the sea-coast of the Outer Lands as well as along the Nye side of the Great Lake of Bye. 

Internal Conflicts
The felinish operators in the FTA are particularly loyal to Grim Malek's clan, who form a sub-org within the larger network. Cat fights (yuck-yuck) occur from time to time as younger players seek to dislodge Grim Malek and their immediate family members. 
External Conflicts
The FTA is often at odds with authorities from Byenung, who are sticklers for doing things properly, as well as with competing bitamin gangs on the Nye Lands and in neighboring Mobalbesq, where the powerful family networks use the FTA's service when convenient, but also ice them out of more profitable undertakings, and, to a lesser extent, from Arq, where the competition is more with rag-tag groups and individuals, including some pirates. The Fatunik authorities consider them criminals and do everything they can to prevent the FTA from extending its reach into Pavanarune.  In most of these cases, the identities of key leaders and operatives of the FTA, like Grim Malek, in unknown to competitors.

            <Text>Candlemaker - Scene X    

 Allane entered the hut without saying a word. Illuminated by the light of a single candle, he shuffled to a stool, dropped his bag and sat down, staring at his muddy boots. 

Kaharan poured a teaser of evening s'lah and handed it to him. "Where have you been, friend? I expected you soon after Third Watch. It's nearly Fourth. I was getting anxious." 

"It happened tonight," Allane whispered.
"What?", she asked, "What happened?"

"What you saw in your sleep time." Shaking his head, taking a sip.  "It happened to me."

"You were pursued by a long-haired phantom of the darkness?"

"Yes. But, Kaha, but not a phantom. It was a candlemaker."

She peered out the cabin's little window, scanning the dark forest for a sign of her nightmare. Turned back briefly to demand, "Tell me exactly what happened."  Then resumed her vigil.

 "They've been watching me since I left the Scribes of Heliohan to become a propagator. Sending runners to my father's tannery, to my mother's brood house. Inquiring as to my whereabouts. Claiming I'd requested candles to be delivered.  Asking about my health.

"They've been spreading rumors that I'm not loyal. That I've shamed the light of the Great Candle. It's how they operate. In the shadows. Spreading lies. They put it about that I was consorting openly with the Dauni Vakasaqua. "

Kaharan failing to suppress a laugh, blurted out, "Well hello friend! That part is true! Here I am."

"Yes.  Yes it is. But this is serious, Kaha.  The Center has called for the Holy Fire to be ignited.  They're coming for me. They'll come for you too. When I went into town at Third Watch to get our travel supplies, a candlemaker -- a black robe, not just one of their runners -- a black robe candlemaker followed me back into the woods. I tried to lose him. Took to the lesser-known paths. Doubled back into Toon. Five or six times. In and out of inns and temples.  He cornered me in an alleyway near the Builders Union, behind the market. The one where herders from up north pile their pelts.

"I tried to hide.  He pursued me, calling my name.  Beckoning.  Commanding me to come with him.  To cleanse myself. To return to the light."

Kaharan left her post at the window, sat and looked steadily at Allane. Reached out to calm his trembling hand.  It was moist and sticky.  "That does sound like my dream time. I see it now. But not a phantom of the darkness was it?  A slimy dark-cowled creature of the night, wasn't it? One of Romperando's agents."

Allane let a nervous giggle slip out. "'Creature of the night?' No. No. Heh! Sorry. That's what they call you southerners."

"Oh puh-lease. Have you ever seen me sneaking around in the dark trying to frighten people, Allane?  Good rivers! I can't wait to get out of here. This place is so creepy.”  

 She gasped, “Holy Setta!", as it sunk into consciousness that the stickiness on his hand was blood. "What?..."

"It's fuzzy. I had my small sharp blade with me. I always carry a tanner's blade gifted me by the paterbek.  All I remember is... me and the candlemaker, there in the night, by Endor's light.  Face-to-face. I suppose I must've been drawn towards him by his voice. Telling me to step into the light.  Calling on me to leave the darkness, to come with him. And..."

Kaharan moistened a cloth in the water basin. Wiped her hands, then his. "And?"

"I ended him." He made a slow wave-like motion with his right palm. "Just like that. Four, five, slices to the neck. He just slumped down, then fell backwards. The blood spilled onto his cloak. There was a gurgling sound. When it blotted out his candlemaker's sigil, you know, the glowy sigil on their robes?"  She nodded. " Then I hurried away."


"So you've killed one of Romperando's agents," she said. Not a question. 
"Yes."

"We have to get out of here."
"Yes."

"Tonight."
"Yes."</Text>

            <Text>Tear Down the Walls
Card Number: 36
+ / -  Main conflicts in this scene.

Barq Rob-Eye and the Miners of Eelan take two paths simultaneously.  

First, inspired by the Dauni Vakasaqua and the promise of the Pollinators, Barq leads a group in replanting the barren ground of the old Wall of Fire.

Second, the Eelani militants (such as...? Led by...?) unite with Riders, Empafarasi, the mysterious southern mages and the carrot-eating impuros and their wolvish allies to free SPQ (the big scene in this chapter -- upheaval in Beshquohuk) and take on the Ilyushan.

&gt; &lt;  Main events, resolutions, actions in this scene.

Tie the liberation of SPQ in with the previous section where Birakay sneaks in to see him in captivity.

Barq helps the Eelani (how?) to realize that they need to reinvent themselves, to open up to new ways, that simply restoring 'the way things use to be' (meaning relying on an alliance with the Riders) or remaining isolated from the other Lands won't work any more. They need to play a role not only in, literally, reviving the Land, as the DV and SPQ have said, but also in introducing a more natural and democratic way of life to the other provinces.

(Need more good Eelani characters.)

Should the Empafarasi airships be launched here? Do we first see them floating over the work being done by the Pollinators?

Finish --&gt;  The rains turn the weirs into big washes. Dams are opened up. As the storm clouds move east, the sun comes out in the west (foreshadowing the next card); the Pollinators move into the freshly irrigated lands between Eelan and the Borda Woods, sowing all sorts of flowers, grasses, and fruits.

 Timeline

Continue directly from Cards 35. .
Beauty

Yin and Yang separate, intertwine, intermingle. Not all conflicts are violent. It is the back-and-forth movement of the energies that brings life alive.
Humor

SeeAct II, Scene V Shakespeare's "Two Gentlemen of Verona". Thinking to use a pastiche on it to introduce the dénouement involving BIrakay and Stanley. Perhaps, in the midst of all that has happened so far, with Tonedo and Lohrn away from the Center, Birakay is permitted to visit Stanley in captivity in Beshquohuk. (Do we have a role for Roís yet? Perhaps he is a sympathetic guard who secrets Birakay in to see SPQ.) They have a somewhat confusing dialog about Showan and Ramona, where Stan learns of Showan's death and, at the same time, of Birakay's love for him and determination to get him freed. (They both get boners. :-) )  
Truth

From the intertwining of the two energies, the waters flow in eight directions, then co-mingle and interchange once again, spawning 64 possibilities. The two rivers begin to connect. 

Impact

Supreme Ultimate flow starts up between the Setta and the Pavan, echoing the really, really big radio themes alluded to earlier.

Try to develop a kind of program (or literally, a program) to “predict” (control) weather patterns in the various parts of the Lands.

See notes on Tides and Time

Take into consideration:
- Agency management within the Enclosure, influences from outside the Enclosure
- Geography: mountains; east-west, north-south
- Seasons

===

The weather in Saskantinon is generally warm, but there is a change of seasons.  

Districts closer to the Krbsh Delta and the Bay of Bar, are warmer and can be very humid.  

In western hills and mountains to the north , cooler breezes prevail and occasional strong winds. Tornados are not uncommon.  It sometimes snows in these areas too, especially in the westernmost mountains bordering Aranzen and the Krunkinotto.  

Consider when/where earthquakes and tremors might occur. Decide if / where there might be volcanoes.

Eastern regions get rain fairly regularly.  Both rivers, especially near Deltas, tend to flood every few years. Floodplain of the River Pavan is given over to agriculture that depends on these occasional inundations.  The southern River Setta, on the other hand, gives way to a complex series of small and large dams and canals, some of ancient vintage.  The Great Dam of The Runes of Bye is a popular destination for travelers touring the Ring for its grand sights.
 
Though it seldom reaches as far south as the Setta, every once in a great while a deep freeze descends on the region.  This is a time of catastrophe in most traditions, both huum and sentient.  The more militant forces of the Heliocastron tend to leverage such hard winters as a trigger for launching pogroms, which is to say an elevated Gleaming, against those perceived to have brought it on due to their connivance with Lunik forces.

            <Title>Summary</Title>
            <Text>Aranzen is the most highly cultured of the Border Lands. It is the only neighboring “Land” that is not considered to be full of “barbarians”, “creatures of the Sky”, and so on.

It is, however, considered by loyal Fatunik Thinkers, to be “untidy” and, well, just plain weird. 

Home to many mixed and powered folks, Aranzen has a large coastal border on the Aran Sea, facing south. There is some trade and travel between Aranzen and towns of Harvest, Barbol and especially Terpinol. 

The back-story is that Aranzen was founded, inhabited by refugees coming from the West, while the Saskan Lands were settled mostly by refugees from the North and East. The most apparent difference between the Saskan and Aran cultures is their language. While most of the Saskan languages bear some resemblance to each other, the Aran languages are utterly different.

Physically, the Aranzen folk — descended from refugees of all types — have the same level of diversity seen in most of the Saskan Lands, but with mixed physiologies being more common. 

It is commonly thought that the “Enclosure” surrounds Aranzen to the West and the South. In some versions of the mythology, sailing too far into the Aran Sea (as with the Krbish Sea) means falling off the edge of the world. </Text>

            <Text>Jesse K a/k/a Gabriella a/k/a Star Woman, etc.
Undeterminable • All over then place

Role in Story
Like Calley Coola, Jesse K is something of a villain. Canonically, a bit of Approaching The Mystery.  A Muse of sorts.

Goal
Injecting yet another level of complexity into the overall orchestration, Jesse K is a rebel from the Agency, a fallen angel as it were. She wants to blow open the uselessness of the Agency and expose their lack of direction, failure to succeed in their mission.  But has little if anything in the way of an explanation either for their action or her own. Likes to stir things up just to see what will happen.

Physical Description
Similar to Calley Coola but more flamboyant, with larger and more varied hats, more spectacular boots, cloaks and gowns that float about even when there is not wind.  

Personality
Prefers to act utterly contrary to all accepted wisdoms. Contradicts pretty much everything anybody says regarding the ways things are.  Expresses a lot of sympathy for the creatures of the Ilyushan and for the “imprisoned and manipulated” Jaxen.   Likes to tell Saskan folks that they live in a prison or a zoo and they don’t realize it.  

Friend and possibly occasional lover to Calley Coola.  Likes to point out the foolishness of others, but is not too aware of her own lack of direction.

Occupation
Widely considered to be something like a witch and a member of the so-called Mages Guild.  She is an anarchist.  Feel free to borrow from my anarchist texts to flesh her out.

Took some tech with her upon exit from the Agency that allows her to travel very quickly and gives her clothes a floaty look.  Her scooter might be interpreted as something like a broomstick…

Spends a good amount of energy just avoiding being arrested. Stirs up trouble wherever she goes.  Is known as a purveyor of gemstones that have magical properties, such as helping with healing or allowing for communications over long distances. 

Habits/Mannerisms
Loves to dance.  Likes to organize groups into something called Purple Parties who help to organize presentations of The Antelope Dance. Fond of outrageous characters and seeks them out, often being the instigator but not the executioner of various wild schemes. 

Background
A native of the Ilyushan Mountains, Jesse K was recruited by the Agency at a young age, given various kinds of training and then went AWOL when learning of the real picture regarding the Enclosure, the Monitoring and so on.  Believes that the Enclosure should be destroyed and the various creatures allowed to find their own destiny without interference from the Agency.  

Has a kind of coven-leader relationship with 3M 

Internal Conflicts
Similar to Calley Coola, feels like nobody listens to her warnings and her advice. 

External Conflicts
Constantly on the run from authorities, especially the Heloptics, but the Riders and others are not terribly fond of her either.  Dauni Vakasaqua are as likely as Heloptics to condemn her as a bad influence.  
Story-lines
See The Story of the Hill People’s Dance.
See Mur'ray, another Ilyushan who is considered outré by Saskantinonians but fairly normal by Ilyushan standards.
May have strategic interests aligned with the Aranzenners.

            <Title>Full Moons RIsing</Title>
            <Text>Hi, Visitors.  

Azron Gurk, Saskan Lands Observation Unit E-10, reporting on sub-vocal recorder. Standard Gavor Date 4875 point 145. Nearly the end of Fifth Watch. Have tracked two potentials to the rebel side of Ríkila Ringtoon. They breezed into the Inn of the Full Moons just before Fanon Rest.

Endor and Sella, along with two of the minor satellites, are fully lit in Fanon Light tonight. Spirits at the Inn are bright as the moons light and are rising quickly as the Krbsher tide. 


Thinker Stanley P. Quinn, of the Mobal Beshqi Free Thinkers Guild, is lugging a pack of scrolls. Visual scan at a distance shows a haggard face for one so young, with a sour countenance. He's either worried or having gastrointestinal issues. Or both.  His eyes are alert, steadily scanning the surroundings. Quinn has been drinking s'lah continuously since arrival. May soon be tipsy.  Or ill. Either case could provide an opportunity for a closer approach.

Thinker Quinn is accompanied by his friend and colleague,  Showan of the Nywing Runes, Magister for the Byenung Committee for Advancement of Reasonable Argument. As the eldest issue of the highest ranking readers of the Runes of Bye, oddsmakers from Nyetoon expect that one day he'll inherit the High Seat on the Night Hall First Bench from his mother, High Magister Showna of the Nywing Runes. 

I'm not taking their odds. Seems like a long shot to me. The old bird shows no signs of stepping down any time soon. A devoted fan of Stan at Mobal Beshqi conferences over the past two turns, Showan has taken a strong interest in recent radical Arguments put forth by the young Thinker.  The two have known each other for at least ten turns; they're tight as a team of Kahilakol bandits. Attended the Academy at Terpinol at the same time, then travelled the Ring together for six Sellaturns before taking on their respective residences.

The Nywing Magister is holding the Mobal Beshqi's arm as they converse, in whispers, heads closely bowed, making it difficult to read their voices. The pub hubbub is mostly in that heavily accented Eibarq affected by "Free" Ríkilans when there's no Tagabants watching. But I suspect they are speaking in one of their native tongues, either Sogomsh or Arqa. 

The full moons conjunction celebration is spinning up. Literally. The dancing has started. The Inn is filling with revelers. A band of performers who came all the way from the Settarune have just arrived. Causing a stir with their unabashed gender presentations and turning heads with their lilting southwestern Sogomsh accents.  

Will try for a better scanning trajectory. Sliding in closer for possible direct contact with the potentials.

            <Title>Powers</Title>
            <Text>I want to avoid a straight Gamma World or superhero or mutant type of storyline.  If this were to become a comic book, it would be situated in a different kind of genre.

This is a science-fiction story more so than a D&amp;D/fantasy world one. Any powers need to have some kind of explanation, even if the physics of it is questionable.

Nevertheless, there are elements of supra-huum capabilities arising in some cases. This can easily be conflated with magical or other influences and so on, as well as theories about the Agency's influence. The origins of the powers can reside in the more-or-less typical comic book explanations... tied into the overall DNA-mixing theme in a meaningful way, hopefully, along with some engineering of ET and terrestrial origins.  Some powers come from technological enhancements rather than biological origins.  

With the killer bugs, a wee nod to Starship Troopers, but also tied into the incompetence of the overlords. The arrival of the bugs within the Enclosure is an accident, not part of the zookeepers’ plans.

Likewise, the re-emergence of birds should present a different perspective on powers, as well as on evolution. What if things are re-booted on an avian rather than mammalian basis? What types of powers would be considered extraordinary then?

If possible, without getting too worked up about or too literal about it, would like any powers to tie to some specific origin and not just be explained away as 'magic'. Please no werewolves, zombies or vampires.  Though we will have shadowy 'monsters'. 

Categories of powers

Strength
	◆	Large muscle mass
	◆	Excellent muscle control
	◆	Rapid attack

Speed
	◆	Short bursts of high speed

Aromas
	◆	Attraction odor
	◆	Repellent odor

Bites/Injections/Poisons
	◆	Paralyzing
	◆	Deadly

 Other? 

Use the Saskan Schema software to inventory, describe, categorize powers. Then pick a few that help drive the story.

            <Title>Monmar Massachawa</Title>
            <Text>Monmar Massachawa
32 • Somewhere in the High Weir Lands

Role in Story
A bandit leader who is proud of the independent culture of the High Weir Lands, distinct from -- though not opposed to -- the Empafarasi legacy there. 

A fallen angel. The dark force. An enigma. The anima.
Goal
Monmar is a strong female leader who is neither overly sexualized nor gender-neutralized.  Her connection to story-lines regarding flight -- she is another one of the bird-related characters -- brings the Agency's know-how into the picture.  

Physical Description
Tall, strong, lithe.  Has woodpecker DNA, which gives her a strong not-to-be-fucked-with natural punk rock look. Openly female but not femme.  Demands respect. Is a leader and considers herself elite.

Personality
Commanding.  Intelligent.  Does not like to be trifled with. Does not suffer fools gladly. 

Occupation
Trained as an astro-pilot by the Agency, then returned to the Saskan Lands to assist in the development of the Empafarasi, mainly in order to counter the aggression of the Jaxen.  Ostensibly she leads a very clever bitamin gang located in the mountains north of High Weir called the Circle of Fives.

These are interlocking cells of agents, each actually with 7 members, who communicate in a systematic way via the member of each cell designated as the Dominant Seventh.  In Saskan terms, this resonates as something of an argumentative take on  Scarcity and Plenty, with its philosophical emphasis on Sixes plus a Gap.

MM, as she is sometimes referred to, was instrumental in organizing a number of the actions that led up to the Event in Ríkila and led to the astonishing arrival of the Empafarasi Riders that turned the battle for the Toon in favor of the Moonic forces. 
Habits/Mannerisms
A technical whiz, given her natural capacities and her Agency training. Has introduced numerous contraptions for use by the Circle. Careful to hide the connection to the Agency, even from her colleagues in High Weir.  
A consummate leader, she is always planning the next caper and thinking several moves ahead of her competitors and opponents. Abjures having a large public presence. Is willing to take the same types of risks she expects from members of her network.

Background
Wanted by both Fatunik and Rider Authorities for numerous crimes, including piracy, grand larceny, unsanctioned trade, tax evasion, kidnapping, terrorism, murder, espionage, having incorrect and heretical thoughts, parasitism,  and the illegal propagation of proscribed song cycles.

On her record at the Agency she is red-flagged for unlicensed operation of a deep space vehicle, attempted manipulation of the time line, and improper handling of wormhole gravitons.  She  also has commendations for expert piloting, expert marksmanship, and advanced understanding of inter-universal atonal vibrational dynamics at meta-quantum manifold frequencies. 

She is very fond of many kinds of music and insists that members of the Circle learn multiple song cycles as well as some aspects of music theory.

Internal Conflicts
In her younger days, had an on-again, off-again affair with the other MM, Mikel Moballeq. At one point it seemed that would develop into a long-term partnership, something that she was about to propose to MM, at which point Mikel and Azron Gurk got involved in a long, complicated philosophical discussion that lasted for four days. During this time, Jesse K contacted Monmar and laid out the first set of proposed guidelines for the Circle of Fives.  This led to… well, a lot of work.  Monmar never found the time to return to MM with her proposal.  She sometimes struggles with this decision, and occasionally yearns for a more peaceful life she could share with a partner who is her equal and with whom she might be able to share her whole story.  She is kind of lonely. 

External Conflicts
Many.  With the Jaxen, she is in constant combat. With the Heliops, she is a major threat.  With the Riders, she threatens their monopolies.  With the Dauni Vakasaqua of Low Weir and the Legalists of The Runes of Bye, she is too much of a trouble-maker, too radical.  With Kahila and other bitamin and romperi outfits, she is competition. With the Agency, she is difficult if not impossible to control and often goes off the radar as well.  With the Empafarasi of High Weir, she must deal with a lot of stupidity and egoism from folks who are nowhere near her equal.

+ / -  Main conflicts in this scene.

Showan uses his connections in Byenung to get info about Stanley's plans. The Bye/Nye competition. 

Birakay is bold and brash and beautiful. He receive threats after his Song of Henqu becomes popular.

&gt; &lt;  Main events, resolutions, actions in this scene.

A Birakay performance stirs hearts, minds and other body parts. His Song stirs up trouble.

An Argument moves to the Pool. The ideas being put forward from Bye and Nye have caught the attention of the Elders of Juuj, but the Romperandondos don't approve.

Finish --&gt; The dissident Elders are silenced.


Timeline

Six months (?) prior to the opening scene.

Beauty

A performance in Qurol is a sight to behold.

The Pool at Juuj is deep and sits inside an oddly echo-y cavern/cernote, punctuated by cave-like passageways.

Humor

Even the Untamed swoon for a Briakay performance.

Truth

Power is threatened by new ideas and takes steps to preserve itself.

Impact


Things are a mess. Who is paying attention?
An unrequited lover was torn from his grip.
A philosopher is not appreciated in their own time.

            <Title>Ch 8 - Summary</Title>
            <Text>With Maatsuuv, whom we met in Selaron, we see a wise-old woman (well, woman-rabbit), and learn about her loyal community of militants. We ...
- Learn about the language question, 
- Learn about the symbolic importance of carrots to the underground militant sentient animal community,
- Learn what the Dauni Vakasaqua spend most of the efforts on, 
- Learn about Low Weir and the travails of Kaharan and Allane.

Most of this chapter is tales told by Maatsuuv.

(It may belong elsewhere. Not sure yet how it fits into the action flow. If it is just exposition, consider skipping it or setting it aside.)


The Untamed communities come into a fractalized view. The immense complexities of sint politics come into focus. Raise questions about whether there is a Force that really is out there and really is greater than ourselves. 

The southern Dauni Vakasaqua culture is revealed in some depth, both regarding its role in the survival of the Saskan Lands agriculturally-speaking, and in the immensity of its traditional, mythic understanding which rivals that of the huum. This is a consciousness that flows in its own river, both literally and figuratively. 


Both rivers course around and through the Mobalbesq and other eastern zones, into the Krbsh Sea.

A new lietmotif is introduced as the main theme emerging from the Auction, one with even more variations than the northern. 

This is all a kind of “high”. There has been a turn in the telling. The music is more cheerful, more playful, sillier in some ways. We’re now meeting huum and others with powers, many more characters with altered appearances, and quite a few talking animals.  All hinting at an entirely different solution to the problematization of the anthropocene as posed by the Riders and the Authority. 


Sadness too, as we learn about Allane and Kaharan, but here it is the struggle for ideas, for practices promising great and practical transformation, and not so much of the fear-based submission to either father-sun or work to become individual-hero-savior.


This is left in Act One only as a taste of things to come, almost a dream. Maatsuuv returns to her underground lair.

            <Text>A Mobalbesqan naval flotilla that includes our intrepid voyagers returning from Wing Island stops at the Setta Delta to pick up advisors from The Runes of Bye, then at Selaron to drop off supplies for the defense of Ríkila, along with other trade goods. 

As the ships approach the Bay of the Pavan, they spot creatures pouring into the Sea from the Forg and the Ilyushan.   

The landing at the Towers of the Pavan Bar is done surreptiously and quietly, with many of the non-huum sints and allies recruited from the realm of the Delphine Queen swimming up the river towards Ingar rather than exposing themselves to detection by Heliops at the Pavan Bars.

Warriors led by Mikel Moballeq (?) and/or maybe Barqalod (?), recruited in the Outer Lands, are moving northwards, starting to arrive in the Pavan Bay area at the same time that the ships are arriving. 

Local authorities examine the documents provided by Luvcando the Shanowan,while  the Sea Watch at the Pavan Bars is thrown into shock when they see ravens flying towards Ingar.  

They are even more appalled when gulls and pigeons start arriving on the docks, arguing and carrying on, as they do.

===

Continuing to explore the underground tunnels of the western lands, plans are revealed for gliders, kites, balloons, parachutes. 

All those kinds of things that have been carefully denigrated and misdirected by the Agents have been subtly encouraged by the dissident Jaxen.

Card Number: 41
+ / -  Main conflicts in this scene.

In the Dissident Jaxen enclave in the southern Krunkinotto, deep underground, the machines are re-booting following the devastating EMT that took them down. They have some huum and sint helpers (who?... Trace back for continuity, who are the main "collaborators" with the Jaxen?) ]

Remanj Jaxen and other pods of dissidents are manufacturing artificial bees, insects, birds to help expand the pollinators' initiative, to help the huums, sints and animals survive.


In the northern Krunkinotto, another faction is recovering as well. They are developing advanced rocketry and explosives, reviewing plans for flying machines acquired from the Empafarasi.

(How do we know what's going on with the authoritarian Jaxen? Who is our reporter there? Need some character development in that camp. Has Remanj developed a way to spy on them? Does he have an ally there? And vice-versa?)

Yes, Remanj Jaxen is involved in both. Set this up a lot more. Turns out he is like a quadruple agent, with his fingers in all the pies. (How does that make any sense?) 

His real pal, advisor and helper is B'arqo.
&gt; &lt;  Main events, resolutions, actions in this scene.

An old dog is watching them. Tie the Remanj / B'arqo relationship all the way back to the opening scene. This can be a long-burn kind of surprise, that their relationship is so close, but be sure to drop plenty of hints. 

B'arqo gets around a lot. How does he do that? Mechanical fish pulling his boat? River dolphins? Both? He is in very good shape for an old guy. 


Finish --&gt;  Remanj and B'arqo get a line of sight into the Jaxen rocket development lab. They set off towards the Mistral Tower to warn the Empafarasi.

 Timeline

During the 6 months after Card 38.
Beauty

A boy (robot) and his dog (man) hiking together through the forested weir lands, noting the new-born and new-manufactured life-forms taking shape -- birds, bees, butterflies, flowers, fruit trees.
Humor

Show an expression of typical boy and dog activities, say like fetching or a look of wanting-to-please. But everything is kinda topsy-turvey. B'arqo is young again, has found a pal he can relate to. Remanj is feeling emotions. Maybe they go swimming, evoking something like the Don Henley song "Boys of Summer" with something of the sexy naivité of "Boys on the Rock" mixed in.
Truth

Again, but with feeling --&gt; “Our awareness is all that is alive and maybe sacred in any of us. Everything else about us is dead machinery.” – Kurt Vonnegut, Breakfast of Champions

Impact

Something for quirky sci-fi fans to love. An ode to "A Boy and His Dog", "Buckaroo Banzai", "Repo Man", and every Tom Swift Jr. story ever written, then read again years later when stoned.

            <Text>Gallex
20 seasons • Nye Lands

Role in Story

A non-Kahila, non-Fatunik unshaped, unmodified huum associated with one of the more powerful Nye Lands militias.   
Goal
Gallex likes to make clear the distinction between Stargazers and Astrologers.  

Physical Description
Part of the Stargazing Pentrak Clan, like many Nye Landers, Gallex is lithe, quick, dark, strong and does not present a specific gender to those not close to them.

Personality


Occupation
Apprentice to a commander of the Nye Lands `Naught’ militia, a mercenary group located in the interior of the Nye Lands who driven ideologically by Stargazing. They have ties to most of the militant, bitamin and romperi circles in Byenung, Nye Lands, Morilly and Barqton, including the FTA.  They have some naval knowledge, but operate mostly on the rivers not the sea, which is dominated by the FTA. 

Trained in the use of knives and bows.  Gallex being groomed to help organize refugee defense units and possibly to foment dissent within Fatunik Guard units. 

Habits/Mannerisms


Background
Parents were defectors from the Toon of Stanbuk in the Tobaloon who’d rejected Fatunik social norms and started to live together as a heteronormative couple. They raised their first child themselves, in secret, but were found out when the mother was pregnant was the 2nd child — Gallex.  Although small families are not strictly contrary to Fatunik law, they had also begun to secretly study astrological materials.  When the eldest child was caught by the Fatune Tagabant singing a popular Kahila ditty having to do with the motion of the 3rd Wanderer, the entire family was sanctioned and scheduled. Fearing the worst at the next Gleaming, they escaped first to Brokilly then made their way down the Setta to Byenung.  There they were kidnapped and interrogated by the Pentrak Clan, who eventually took them away to the Nye Lands.

The children quickly adapted and thrive in the free-flowing Pentrak lifestyle.  The parents work as field hands supporting the Pentraks.

Internal Conflicts
The Stargazer belief system is in sharp contradiction to Sun worship. It is effectively the mirror-opposite.  While the parents of Gallex had developed a kind of liberal opposition to the Sun-centered beliefs and traditions, the Stargazers have trained Gallex to distrust the parents, whom they still suspect as potential deep infiltrators or spies and keep fairly isolated from their offspring — just as the Heliops sought to do. 

External Conflicts
The family have been found “star-crossed in extremis” by the Dorq Tagabant, which is to say, more or less declared to be “witches”.   The fact that the kids are also now members of a Kahila-friendly armed group puts them near the top of the list of “enemies of the state” as far as Juuj and Beshquohuk are concerned.

The Days of Gleaming begin.
Iohane's and Henqu's hopes for rescue perish in the flames.

Waleran confirms that B'arqo's premonitions were correct, fears for SPQ's life, sends urgent messages to contacts in all the lands.

&gt; &lt;  Main events, resolutions, actions in this scene.

MM's team makes it to Beshquohuk where they attempt unsuccessfully to rescue Iohane and Henqu.

Following the omen that appeared in the Deep Pool in Juuj, and Iohane's defiant singing of Birakay's song, a popular rising erupts in Beshquohuk.

Reports pour in (to whom?) regarding varied protests, both peaceful and violent, against the sacrifice of the Two Riders, about the vile murder of a Candlemaker, of sightings of the terrorist gang led by Monmar Massachawa, of stirrings among the Kahila and the Nye-folk, of mobilizations among the Empafarasi, and even of Volunteers and Garda abandoning their duties. 

Birakay's song cycle is now openly being described by some as _the_ New Song.

Finish --&gt; The Authorities in Beqhquahoek authorize a crackdown.
Timeline

Action --&gt; Following directly from chapter 9c.
Beauty

Iohane's Calvary.
Humor

MM's comment on Tonedo should be along the lines of: "This man may look like an idiot and act like an idiot, but don't be fooled. He really is an idiot."
Truth

Living things do not actually "grow" in the sense of a given thing -- a molecule let's say -- getting bigger. That is a kind of illusion. Yes, bones "grow" and flesh "grows" but the underlying reality is that living cells are multiplying and becoming increasingly interactive, tied together in increasingly complex ways through myriad chemical and physical chains of reactions. 
Impact

SPQ's real "crime" is being a "criminal philosopher", particularly with respect to choosing to ignore the nationalism, racialism, speciesism and particularist genealogy of popular authority and focusing his attention instead on the here and now, on observable facts, and on valuing the particular dignity and intelligence of dignified, intelligent entities over the "common historical knowledge" espoused by popular and established mouthpieces of statist authority.

Mostly farmers, some miners and craftspeople. All Terrapinas are considered members of the same clan.  Trade in minerals creates enough wealth to fund a Terrapina welfare network and is also used to hire song-catchers.  Their interest in music, unlike most traditions in the Saskan Lands, is mainly absolute/instrumental, including sonorous harmonic chanting something like some buddhist monks do in our lands.

Also provisioners of several high-end herbal s'lah preparations. 

A few giant Terrapinas have initiated a conveyance service, taking travelers to various places of interest around the Ring and its environs.  These tend to be happy affairs, but not for anyone in a hurry.

+ / -  Main conflicts in this scene.

Petra Bearbek is not playing this game. But she ends up playing this game.

Some things are literally getting ready to rise.

The Jaxen are not united.

&gt; &lt;  Main events, resolutions, actions in this scene.

Snek has eyes everywhere. Snek sees many things.

The story-line resolves back into real time in this chapter with a kaleidoscope view of short adventures around the outer, southern, western lands and on the border with Ilyushan: 

	•	In Terpinol, the Academy is meeting to review agents reports and take next steps
	•	A ship from Aranzen is docked at Terpinol. Foreign wizards are attending the conference.
	•	At the port in Barqton, a ship has been spotted in the Bay of Bar heading towards the Great Canal, flying the colors of the Komikol. (?)
	•	Small flying creatures have been spotted among the irrigated vegas and weirs of the southern Weir Lands. Some think it is proof of SPQ's conjectures; others think it is a Jaxen ploy. (It is the latter)
	•	Members of the Old Mill Co-op discover vast underground caverns, with water flowing underground
	•	They stumble upon an Empafarasi hanger for balloons and blimps
	•	They encounter a confusing situation with what seems to be a breakaway, refugee pod of Jaxen, all named Remanj, who warn of an impending Jaxen assault on the Empafarasi strongholds.
	•	A ship is being prepared for a long journey in the port of Selaron
	•	Two Trees is about to be overrun by a monstrous assault from Ilyushan
	•	Word spreads like wildfire among the Untamed and the Afflicted that Malavorra (and by implication, though not in fact, the Dauni Vakasaqua) has joined with the Eelani and the Empafarasi. They flock towards the Eelani Crossing to join the Western Army.
	•	A great assemblage, including much of an unexpected Rabble, forms in the Eelani Hills, and begins marching north along the Ring Road.

In each vignette...

As the greater journey rolls along,  heroes and anti-heroes encounter numerous difficulties and some losses on their journeys. Each explores the dark deep pool in a unique way, but encountering similar motifs. They explore the death drive in some detail as they each pursue an impossible goal, acting as if it all makes sense, against all sensibility.

The Empafarasi and the Dauni Vakasaqua enter the picture in greater detail. Along with some of the more mysterious enclaves like the Academy at Terpinol, the Old Mill Collective, the Moballeq Tribe, and the "far south" (Barqton and the Komikol -- hinting at the origin of SPQ and Ramona in a faraway ancient land). The underground caverns of the western lands have their own shadows and pools, but this time the shadows are being openly absorbed, allowed in, conversed with, and transformation begins. 

Finish --&gt; MM's team emerges from a long dangerous underground journey, severely shaken, in the woods outside of Beshquohuk, near the compound where SPQ is being held. 

Timeline

Action --&gt;  All pretty much in real-time. 
Beauty

Many musical themes can overlap, creating a profound sense of harmony and counter-point that is bigger and more exciting than the individual melodies.
Humor

People freaking out about seeing things fly. 
Truth

It is never the name of a particular term, but only of an event, that is able to arise from the void, creating multiplicity out of unity.   The mandate of heaven spreads out not from a particular structure, but from a subtle change in energies that develop into a sudden thunderclap.
Impact

This chapter is all about building anticipation, in both fearful and joyful respects. Something is building. Something is about to happen. Everybody can feel it.

            <Text>Calley Coola
Older than the Hills • Ingar

Role in Story
A dose of cynical realism.  The chorus.  A line of sight into the Toon of Ingar and the area where Saskan &amp; Ilyushan lands meet  — foggy, mysterious, hard to fathom.  Believes that the dominance of machinic life over biological life is inevitable. 

Goal
Minor character. Something like comic relief, but in a negative way. Zizikian humor. Also helps to establish where the Enclosure is located, why so little is known outside of the Saskan area.  

Physical Description
Prone to wearing cloaks, dark clothes, gloves, boots, big hats, masks of various kinds. Tall, a bit bent over sometimes. 

Personality
Doom and gloom all the time and likes it that way. 

Occupation
Who knows?  Presumed by most to be part of the (so-called) Mages Guild.  Associated with the M3 network.  On-and-off-again friend/lover to Mur'ray.

Habits/Mannerisms
Full of cynical observations prior to the events of the story.  Participates in organizing resistance to shadowy monstrous invasions from Ilyushan, while at the same time speculating on what kinds of pain and suffering they endure and how the Ilyushananan “mists” drive them to such extremes.  Full of cynical observations after the events of the story.
Able to disappear into the shadows and the mist as needed.

Background
Came to Ingar from the Ilyushan Hills. Knows much more about that area than lets on. Is convinced that the out-of-control hunger that lurks in the shadows will one day overwhelm the Saskan Lands, no matter which theory of song wins the day.  Expects the Ilyushan monsters will destroy the world, no matter what the Agency, or the Aranzens, or the Mobalbesqers, or anybody else, does.

Internal Conflicts
The usual ones for a Cassandra. No one ever listens. 

External Conflicts
Unpopular with the Fatunik Authority.  Always on the Watch List.

            <Title>Act I - Summary 01</Title>
            <Text>ACT I - Summary 1

These Act-level summaries were written before the beat sheet was developed. Consider them as a draft to be played with. This was the initial draft of an Act One summary.
===



The first Act has an Oedipus/Daedalus pattern to it. 
There is a fall, a rise, and a fall.
Introduce settings important to the whole epic but avoid descriptive bullshit. 
Introduce key characters, with focus on main ones and heroes.
Distinguish narrators from actors.
Set the apocalyptic setting. This world is dying. 


The Big Fall is the World itself.
Multiple small falls and close-ups reveal character flaws and problems. 

Rise in small ways with joy and wonder. Explore the two rivers and the lands between and around them. Our gaze deepens through the wisdom of B'arqo, Maatsuuv and other sympathetic narrators. 

A musical interplay creates melodic movement between the Sun and Moons worshippers, between the stern-ness of the Northern Riders and the playful-ness of the Southern Dauni Vakasaqua, with hints of even more “going on out there”. It is difficult and frightening to consider what is Beyond. An ancient story underlies the relations between east and west, between north and south.

As we meet travelers on the ring road and the rivers, as we peer down those crossroads, and get to know more of the towns a sense of the unique musical surprise inherent in each of them starts to emerge, along with a sense that our journey itself may be plotting out some new probabilities. 

A first glimpse of the the eastern port towns on the Krbsh Sea, and of the confusing energy of Byenung, lends a note of adventure to the whole mix. Nothing is certain. Things could change. There is even more going on.

Birakay, Phoenix, Showan Nywing and Azron Gurk introduce humor, tragedy, romance and sex appeal.

Dive into the legal and philosophical struggles between Heliops and Byerunics.  Lead the reader to some rich veins of code-breaking.

Hint about the western lands. Discover the unique relationship of Low Weir to the southern lands. Paint a picture of the separateness of the Weir Lands from the huum cultures of the north, central and eastern zones. Open up a palette of questions and wonder.  Hint at hope.  

Learn that there are other lands, more remote and mysterious places: Aranzen, High Weir, the autonomous lands of the western hills, the Krbsh Sea and more. Leave audience with the sense that on the margins of the bleak world of safety created by the Heliops and Riders, there is more, possibly more dangerous, possibly more wonderful, that is lurking in the margins.

Show their failures and flaws. Dash their hopes and dreams.

B'arqo. 
	•	The Mages and Bard
	•	Told during his visits to eastern inns, B'arqo’s stories take us on a journey through the Lands.  Learn the lay of the lands as he recounts efforts to gather songs.

Kahilafolk. 
	•	Songs of the Kahilakol. Rompers and bitamin culture. Hints of the western lands.
	•	Kirill Geckter opens the ornate door to the swashbuckling east. 
	•	The predominance of the eastern gangs is threatened by the rise of Monmar Massachawa. The history and politics of East vs. West is complex and tragic.
	•	Mur’ray shows why the Kahila are feared. The depths of treachery and the first distant themes of Ilyushanic shadows echo.

The Untamed
	•	Maatsuuv sings of the strange beauty of enhanced rabbits
	•	The touching tragedy of young rabbit militants taking on battles they cannot possibly win
	•	About carrots. 

The Riders Guild. The great Toon of Borded, 
	•	The tale of Iohane and Henqu brings grandeur and melancholy.  As they travel around the Ring Road, we get familiar with the song steps, the unique contributions of each of the ring towns, and glimpse the sights and sounds of the rivers and the roads. 
	•	Seeing the paths crossing the Ring, and encountering, especially at those crossroads, the languages, song traditions and people from the lands between the rivers and beyond them, start to patch together a tapestry of the whole Saskan Lands.

Mixry.  The Gleaming.
	•	Sints and southerners can easily get into trouble in Heliop territory. 
	•	The dark side of Fatunik justice and duty. 
	•	The actions of Giltraq, just doing his job in Mixry, opens a vista on to the beautiful plains of ordinary mindfulness.

Jivákala
	•	The story of Kam takes a deeper look into Fatunik customs and culture, with hints of secret societies at work on the margins. 

Heliohlan
	•	The distressing story of Kaharan emerges. Through their troubles, we are introduced at a deeper level to the Dauni Vakasaqua, to southern culture more generally, including the tragedy of having no birds or bees. Learn about Terpinol.

Enclosures of an Obvious Kind
	•	Having led the reader to both fall in love with the Lands and their inhabitants,  to have developed some unloving attachments as well, drive home that it is vanishing into dust. Along with the precarious state of agriculture, existential threats from Wesshewen (barbarians), the Krunkinotto (the created ones / the machines / the bugs), and Ilyushan (monsters and shadows) surround the Lands.
	•	Roís tells his frightening tale and reveals his terrifying anxieties.

The Afflicted
	•	That is only the start. Fall hard. Look at how all this affects the regular folks the lands.

Beshquohuk and Juuj
	•	From the Fatunik center during the Days of Gleaming, feel the passion of the fallen Riders.
	•	Allane escapes towards Low Weir.
	•	Qu’rub longs for a better life.
	•	Bu’ruq, deeply unhappy, makes fun of the whole mess.
	•	Rollo of the Dexelites and Remanj Jexan are preparing for the next great conflict.

            <Title>Luvcando</Title>
            <Text>Luvcando Randagan the Shanowan 
29 • High Weir
Common nickname: Luvca

Role in Story
Develop the story of the eastern lands as well as some hints into foreign lands, in this case Shanowa (likely to change that... It is a girl's name, possibly one of those made-up ones. Kind of like it, but also feels a bit too D&amp;D-y.)

Goal
Provide a link to the Agency, and to lands beyond the Enclosure. Trigger some deeper philosophical inquiry.

Physical Description
Entirely huum, but of an appearance not common in the Saskan Lands. (How so?)  Has a foreign accent that is definitely not Wesshewen or Aranzen. Laughs more easily than most in this region, who tend to be a bit reserved/quiet on the whole, especially north of the Setta. 

Personality
Inquisitive, opinionated, cynical. Has little patience with prejudices but is well aware of dangers and threats. 

Occupation
Ostensibly, a black marketeer of sorts, trading in custom-made cutlery and (small) weapons. 

Habits/Mannerisms
Enjoys banter with folks who can carry on an interesting discussion. 
Is an excellent singer and is skilled with both percussion and stringed instruments.

Background

A spy, or emissary, however you want to look at it, from one of the faraway Shanowan Lands, Luvca’s basic mission is just to gather info on the Saskan Lands.  The Shanowans survived the Catastrophe by being technological whizzes. They moved underground for centuries and have also developed some floating cities, both in the clouds and on the waters.  They have become aware of the existence of the Saskantinon civilization only recently.  They are entirely huum, with "machinic" modifications in some cases. 

He makes no secret of where he is from. But many Saskantitnonians have no knowledge of the Shanowan Lands or simply don't believe him

Luvca is also knowledgeable, to some degree, of the actual nature of the Enclosure. Has been enticed with an offer of a trip to the Agency space station A.S.S. upon successful completion of mission to the Saskan Lands.
Internal Conflicts
The info he has about the Agency is vague. Was told to not reveal any aspect of it to folks in Saskan Lands but is finding it difficult to do so as trust is built up with the Empafarasi, with honest, if misled, Stargazers and Mages and others in the Saskan Lands.  At the same time, his encounters with Agents were few and reflected only one aspect of its interventions.

Has become fond of the free-wheeling Kahila culture, especially in Ríkila, which is so different from the tightly-bound Shanown culture. Is becoming involved in intrigues relating to resistance against the Tagabant there, despite instructions from home to stay neutral in any conflicts.  

External Conflicts
During travel from Shanowa to Saskantinon, Luvca became well-informed about the dire threats developing in the Ilyushan Mountains. Understands the need for relying on the Fatunik and Rider forces, for a broad united front, to counter the monsters. This creates some conflicts with contacts, friends, and even allies -- who are all-too-often in conflict with each other.  In other words, he has to navigate the complicated world of Saskan politics in order to accomplish his mission, as well as to do what he can to help.

Story-line

Luvca is instrumental in organizing the expedition to the Remari Islands.

            <Title>Remanj Jexan</Title>
            <Text>Remanj Jexan
20 • village of Unnaghobik in Salotriza, off the road between Mixry and Hádika

Role in Story
Perspective of a poor farmer's family caught up in the winds of war.
A Jaxen who evolves.  The puppet who came to life.
The surname Jexan is a title adopted by members of the Returner sect that he belongs to.  
Goal
Remanj feels all the suffering of the age. He is not invested in any of the existing ideological solutions.  Is not particularly fond of music, but it sometimes captures his attention when it is absolute (non-lyrical).

Physical Description
Long curly red hair. Silver eyes. Handsome in a shy way.

Personality
Sometimes perceived as sneaky and deceptive, the result of his difficult upbringing, fears regarding his parents' disappearance and his odd personality traits, which are due to the fact that he is actually Jaxen, but has been evolving biological traits, including emotional life and independent consciousness separate from the hive.

He does not realize he is machinic. Thinks that the "voices in his head" are dreams and whatnot. Believes that his parents were huum.

Powers
Mild empathetic sort of telepathy -- can detect fear, anxiety, lying and their opposites if he can look a person in the eyes. Likely the result of experimentation carried out on him by one of his now-disappeared huum "parents". 


Occupation
Apprenticed to a small but reknowned "Downer" (psychiatric/psychological care) unit in his village serving mainly Fatunik and Rider military units stationed in the region, particularly those returning from the northern and eastern borderlands.  The unit is led by legendary scanner Rollo of the Dexelites.

Member of a small local Returner cult called the Nightingales.  Their banner is a Red Bird on a white background. 

Occasionally gathers info on commission from the Scanners Detecting Agency of Two Trees, sometimes looking for infiltrators from Ilyushan, but more often a less dire nature.
Habits/Mannerisms
Can read and write proper Eibar. Speaks with a lilting Salotrizan accent. 
Knows some Eibarq and can understand Sogomsh.
Most prized possession is a drawing of his natural parents, who vanished when he was 12.
His closest companion is a natural (non-enhanced-sentience) dog named Fluke.
Skilled at knife-throwing.

Background
Was a Jaxen surreptitiously taken from an inn in Pavanarune Toon.  His "parents" were a rogue agent and a Mobalbesq scientist of sorts who thought they had found a method to make the Jaxen into huum.  Their work on Remanj was their only experiment before they were abducted by the Watch.  They are currently in a tightly-controlled sequestration village outside of Mixry.

Remanj is unaware of his past outside of Unnaghobik, but has a facility for language, along with his empathic powers, that far exceeds anything known in the village. Through his travels, he connected with Rollo of the Dexellites, and works with him as a kind of healer, particularly on the diagnostic side.

His two brothers, Novarick (younger) and Nabalon (older), are both poor farmers in the village eking out a living on the landhold left by their parents. Remanj has traveled on the Ring and encountered a number of characters in the story, several of whom have developed an attraction to him.
Internal Conflicts
Nabalon accused Remanj of being responsible for their natural parents' disappearance, a false accusation that still hurts.

External Conflicts
Drawn into adventuring by wanderers from the Weir Lands when he was 14-ish, Remanj has been around the Ring and has traveled all the way to High Weir and back. He is aware, to some degree of the great conflict that is about to erupt in the eastern lands.  He is anxious to set up a new operation closer to the front, where there are sure to be plenty of troubled clients, but Rollo is not sure Remanj is ready for that. 

The relationship between the 3 siblings, already troubled, suffers because Remanj is often away, not helping with their small farmland.

            <Title>Waleran Tanaraka</Title>
            <Text>Waleran Tanaraka 
32 seasons • from the Barbarana

Role in Story
A guide and story-teller. A cohort of B'arqo and other key players. Provides the perspective of a traditional Settan astrologer with deep knowledge of the southern traditions and languages.

Wizardly in a geeky sort of way.  Has a connection, even if he is unaware of it, to the Agency.
Goal
Provide the Settan perspective and bring the traditionalist, non-Kahila southerners into the story.

Get a deeper dive into the musical/bard traditions of the lands.

Physical Description
Tall, angular.  Always seems to be reading something, consulting charts/manuals, etc.  Practices various forms of moving meditation and martial arts.
Personality
Verbose, a stereotype of an overly educated fool. Has a very high opinion of self and like-minded or seemingly like-minded folk.  Nevertheless, is entirely capable of helping in a fight, especially through the use of mildly advanced technology and weapons, as well as advanced fighting techniques. 
Occupation
Has elementary knowledge of astronomy and mathematics. But it is warped by his strong belief in astrology and a system of fortune-telling that combines astronomical observations with calculations and chanting/meditation. Well-known especially for facility in divining the meaning of “falling stars” and “fast wanderers”. (Which we will eventually find out are mostly spaceships and satellites moving around in the outer atmosphere.)

Habits/Mannerisms
Fond of Terrapina culture. Vegetarian.  Intensely interested in written materials. Has been seeking an audience with Ramona.  Expert in the southern languages, including Doremah.  Fond of music and song but not a talented singer or player himself. A strong sponsor/fan of those who are, c.f. Barakay and Luvcando.
Background
Originally from the wide-open and somewhat wild lands of Barbarana. Considers Terpinol home. Has been to the Land of the Komikol at least once. Has sailed on the Aran Sea and visited Aranzen. Is well-travelled.  Devout member of a Settan River-Soul cult, but -- rather unusually -- is also a leading member of the Star Gazers Academy of Terpinol, specializing in theological analysis of the stars.  Is clueless as to the true nature of the Enclosure, but has a fascinating grasp of the metaphysics of it. 
Internal Conflicts
Deeply cynical despite an up-beat personality. Does not trust/is not satisfied with any of the main or secondary powers, including the Empafarasi, the Eelan, the Seff (octo-folk) and so on.  Has a nagging feeling that nobody really knows what is really going on and he is pretty much right about that.   A pacifist at heart, Waleran is conflicted about having to support / work with militants like Mur’ray and others.
External Conflicts
One of the players being actively monitored by an Agent, Waleran occasionally gets an  external assist in a divination in order to achieve a desired outcome sought by an Agent.  This can contradict establishing stargazing algorithms, which forces Waleran to start to develop a more scientific outlook — which is fundamentally at odds with both Settan and Star-Gazer theologies. 
As a well-known Stargazer, Waleran is pre-sanctioned by the Heliocastron and has to be careful when traveling in the inner Northern areas.

Type of Location

One of the largest and liveliest towns in Saskantinon, Byenung buzzes with activity day and night.  While not a part of the Fatunika, the province has long been closely engaged with Fatunik thought and politics, offering formal Arguments from time to time for consideration by the Ancient Elders.
Byenung is effectively the capital of the non-Fatunik Outer Lands, and has a good bit of influence in the Pavanarune and even Eibar as well. It is the center of much of the trade and cultural life of the region and renowned for its architectural, design and engineering contributions. 

The Night Hall is called that because that is the name of the building in Byenung where it meets. Its dark stone and blackened wood give the immense building a solemn tone. Its intricate carving and decorations make it a marvel to observe. And its many lanterns, candles, fire-stoves, glow-stones and so on, make it dance and glitter with light from within.

26 • Mixry

Role in Story
Member of the Front Tagabant who tries, against the odds, to keep some kind of order in Mixry.
Flees to Ríkila after witnessing the execution of Iohane and Henqu and getting swept up in the uprising. 

In Ríkila, he gets a job cleaning up at the Twelve Moons, where he is housed in one of the small hovels for workers behind the Inn. 

Still ideologically loyal to the Fatunik creeds, but his trust in the Center is shaken. Is taken aback at first by the lack of modesty, willingness to perform genders in the free town.  Discovers that he is more attracted to women than to men. Has trouble explaining why he is in the "starry" side of Ríkila, doesn't have a good cover story, but doesn't want to attract attention. 

He ends up unintentionally betraying the location of on Outerlander resistance camp to the Tagabant. This results in the death of Showan Nywing, who was visiting the camp trying to convince the Kahila and others to take a peaceful path to resistance. His death sparks the Byenung to increase their opposition to the Center and move towards armed resistance.

Shocked by all that, he doubles down on his Fatunik faith, organizes a Volunteer militia that is instrumental in the defense of Ingar and is acclaimed the new Head of the Council of the Eibarfolk after the fall of the Beshquohuk regime.
Goal
Wants to present the Fatunik mission in a benign context -- protecting civilization against chaos -- despite its rather obvious shortcomings.

Physical Description
Huum.  A bro. Big heart.

            <Text>The region is wealthy and prosperous, as compared to bordering regions like Wesshewen, Ilyushan, Krbshanana, the Forgh and even Aranzen.  As compared to our own time, it is closer to subsistence economics, relying on inter-locking systems of institutional centralization and planning, and small-scale barter and markets, with occasional larger-scale auctions and commodities markets.


FARMING

A key reason why so many non-huum stay in Saskantinon despite its somewhat confusing and even harsh political environment is agriculture does well, relatively speaking, in the region. And this is due almost largely to the fact that the Dauni Vakasaqua have learned, since the Catastrophe, how to take the place of birds and bees. They spread this knowledge throughout the Lands and continue to ensure the food supply.

Nearly all of the towns and villages in the area maintain farming operations at one level or another of technological advancement.  Many farmers are free-holders, but work within larger collective groups. In the South, the Dauni Vakasaqua syndicates act as a kind of farmers cooperative. Many others are more-or-less vassals who work to support the nearest town and its institutions.  While the technological level is fairly rudimentary in many areas, the land is fertile enough to support a variety of techniques. 

Domesticated non-sint livestock for milk and cloth (fur) materials is fairly common. Using livestock for food is less common and somewhat controversial, especially outside of the Northern provinces.

Mammalian meat plays a considerably smaller role in Saskan life than it does in our world. Pigs, cows, hares and other species all have sint and mixed cousins who look very unkindly on eating their relatives and feel it is a threat (and not only from huum carnivores).  There are no avians of any type, hence no chickens, etc.  Most meat-eating is aimed at fish, reptiles and insects.   

AGRICULTURAL RESOURCES and ECONOMIC STRATA

Farming and agriculture in the Saskan Lands are difficult and labor intensive. Have been so for centuries.  Elements of prototypical capitalism are evident in several trades. But that is not the case in agricultural work. Some level of private enterprise and corporatism occur in hunting, fishing and harvesting of reptiles and insects. But planting, pollinating, harvesting and caring for the crops, as well as milling, distribution and so on requires coordination, planning and effort well beyond the capabilities of the small-scale Saskan market systems. For example, large-scale stores for hard times are an important feature of the agricultural system.  Many of the Afflicted class are engaged for part of the year in this type of work.  They are basically a landless peasantry who work in exchange for subsistence food stuffs, which are provided year-round. 

All of the major institutional players have a role in coordinating the agricultural systems. The Dauni Vakasaqua and the Outer Land tribes tend to have the most humane approaches to employing the Afflicted. The Fatuniks less so, especially when it comes to non-huum populations.  The role of the Riders organizations, the Empafarasi, the Eelani and other western tribes, as well as the Kahila, in managing the agricultural systems and work relationships lies somewhere in between.


LAND

Though free-holding is common, it is a kind of lease or tenure relationship.  Land "ownership" is general is not thought to be something that an individual or family group can actually do.  There are seldom actual private and individual claims to permanent land sovereignty.  Where it is not in the trust of a local organization or guild or tribe or clan, it is often managed by a collective, which often have existed for centuries, and treated as a  shared equity resource.

This is a reality that grew out of necessity. Due to the manually intensive nature of much agricultural work, it is exceedingly difficult for a small producer or individual owner to make a success at it. Many genetic lines have no solid intellectual or cultural tradition of "private ownership" in any case.

Only in the Weir Lands controlled by the Empafarsi has the idea of "lordship" over land begun to emerge. In the Runes of Bye and the Nye Lands, and to a lesser extent in Mobalbesq, there are centuries-old land tenures held by various clans, which nearly amount to sense of "ownership", but this seldom devolves down to the level of individuals or nuclear families.  In the Kahila Lands, particularly the Kahilakol, the idea of land "ownership" is utterly anathematized through long tradition of open and collective use of the forests and other commons.  


HUNTING and FISHING

The region supports grazing and hunting, especially in the North.  

Both a pastoral and nomadic economies exist in these areas, though nomadic/traveling bands are less common than settled ones, particularly when it comes to fishing. 

Domestication of livestock is much more common in the huum regions of the North than in the South, the Outer Lands or the West. But even there, it is the source of ongoing disputes. Violent conflicts have erupted over the centuries between animal-liberationists and huum-supremacists, often triggered by arguments over meat-eating and management of animals as "stock".  This is not a wholly Huum vs. Sint issue either. There are carnivorous sints.

A variety of wild beasts who are not sentient – in the sense that they do not use tools, use a language intelligible to other species, create urban or village centers, or develop an oral or written literature – roam the plains and mountains, especially in the northern, eastern and southern regions outside of the Ring. 

Hunting expeditions, most often -- but not exclusively -- organized by huum or huum-appearing guilders, work these areas.  They gather and hunt in the western mountains and the river basins too, as well as in the coastal areas, although there tends to be much less available prey in those areas. 

Fishing is common in both rivers and seas, with occasional disruptions from water-resident sints from the Krbsh Sea.

Fishing and sea-going trades are very common in the Eastern provinces. Fishing tends to be a more organized and more pastoral enterprise than hunting, with regular groups fishing specific shore-lines or off-shore areas.  As with hunting, this type of work can be fraught with difficulties and conflict due to the large number of fully sentient animals inhabiting the Delta of Ilyushan as well as the Krbsh Sea itself.  Typically, they themselves are consumers of seafood, so -- as with land-based meat-eating -- the overall picture is not a simple one. 

As far as conflicts go, it is often more a matter of competition between groups than it is an ethical question.


MINING

Mining operations are located mainly in the western mountains, as well as near the marshy Krbsh Sea shoreline of the southeastern Arq speaking region.  


MANUFACTURING

Most manufacturing is at a fantasy-world-medieval level, with a focus on small-scale handicraft. Aside from the large-scale agricultural efforts, there are few large manufactories too. 

Common types of goods include:
- Prepared foods, food ingredients
- Prepared and fermented beverages
- Weapons and Armor
- Clothing and fabrics
- Conveyances (wagons, boats, and so on)
- Tools and Hardware
- Rope and Sails
- Cut stone and wood
- Medicines and psycho-active substances
- Musical instruments
- Scrolls, parchments, books and writing materials
- Pigments and brushes
- Candles, Lamps and Reflective surfaces (mirrors)
- Utensils and Containers

SERVICES

With the exception of agricultural goods, the provisioning of most goods and services is dominated by guild monopolies, though there are competing guilds and geographical variations.  Intellectual work -- writing, philosophy, science, history, theology and so on -- tend to be invested in long-standing institutions like the various Scribes Guilds, which are more or less arms of the various power centers, and the Academy at Terpinol.

See notes below on Trade.

Key service industries are also coordinated through guilds, though some are very loose. These include:
- Scribes
- Innkeepers
- Brooders
- Dauni Vakasaqua (botanists, collective farmers, herbalists)
- Healers and Scanners
- Finders (detectives and thieves)
- Tagabant / Volunteers / Tagabants, etc. (cops and army)
- Riders (protection)
- Bards and Actors
- Carpenters
- Miners
- Sailors
- Advocates
- Hunters
- Smiths (also called Joeys)
- as well as the illicit/occult/secret ones, like so called mages, as well as the bitamin and romperi groups.
- Some more wacky/esoteric groups also exist, like: temple-keepers,  elders, zizooks (philosophers), artists


SCIENCE, ART and TECHNOLOGY




LAND-BASED TRADE

The Ring and its major conduits are the heart of trade, commerce within the Lands. The role of the Riders in protecting the roads makes them crucial to its success and explains why they are closely tied into various commercial Guilds. 

Major guilds manage what we would think of as “stores”.  Most towns host regular “fairs”, on various schedules, and support open-air bazaars for small dealers and individuals. 


RIVER-BASED TRADE

As important as movement of goods on the Ring roads is movement of goods on the rivers and their tributaries. Here the eastern communes in Eibar and Nye Lands and Biver have a bigger influence, as they tend to have the best capacities for maintaining fleets on the rivers, as well as handling sea-borne imports and exports.


SEA-GOING TRADE

In the larger context, sea-going trade in the near-sea is dominated by huum from Saskan Lands and animals or mixed sentients from both Ilyushan and Krbshanana, with some from the Forgh, the Komikol and Aranzen. 

Except for Ilyushan, the regions which border the Fatunika to the East and to the South have enormous coastlines.  In the case of Krbshanana, it also has a large sentient marine population living within the Krbsh Sea itself. 

While we learn about lands further afield, outside the Enclosure, they don’t play an important role in the economy of the Saskan Lands.





MONEY


Summary

The Saskan Lands, though divided into semi-cooperative, semi-competing regions, supports a great deal of trade both within and between the various regions.  There is a fairly complex industrial-manufacturing guild structure and associated political and even religious institutions who support these trade links for both social and economic reasons.  On top of that, there are widespread black markets for services and goods which are banned or restricted in some or all areas.  There is a thriving underground and at least somewhat illegal economy in those cases.

Most trade occurs through five main channels. The first three tend to use fiat currencies (see more on this below), while the last two mostly do not, although formal exchange rate may still apply to the latter in some abstract sense.

* Retail, in the sense of (a) buying goods direct from a guildhall, which in many cases operates like a permanent, often indoor, market, including weapons and armor sales, or (b) buying goods at a town or village market. In most towns and villages there is a near-daily open-air market for small-scale trade in food, clothing, household goods, decorative items and so on, including services on offer, or (c) buying goods or contracting for services at an Inn or Tavern, which often operate as fronts for underground markets. Retail-level pop up markets spring up when ships arrive in port, or when they are preparing to depart. The same applies to land-based caravans. The slow-moving Terrapina Caravans are like a mobile open-air market.

* Wholesale, in the sense of (a) buying supplies for militias, Inns, Brooder houses, farms, and so on in bulk, usually either from a guildhall or a large-scale supplier of agricultural products or meat, (b) large-scale exchange directly between larger enterprises, for example, an armorer or smithy guild regularly buys coal, wood, and materials for making iron and steel from miners and other suppliers, (c) suppliers who have no retail-level customers — mostly mines, some farms and ships — sell/trade only in bulk.

* Foreign. There is not much trade with entities outside of Saskantinon. There is some, particularly in the border regions with Aranzen.  Also with non-huum entities in the Krbsh Sea. This is often conducted in markets for rare goods.  It is one way in which those who know about the constraints imposed by the Enclosure manage to get around them, at least in some small ways.

* Barter. Practiced at the local level, including to some extent in village and town markets, this is the direct exchange of good and services at the small-scale, local level. It is more common among communities with a higher percentage of non-huum DNA. But it is prevalent in all rural areas, throughout the Lands.  Among some less urbanized groups, it takes on at times a quasi-religious significance. These exchanges take on the form of a gifting ceremony at one extreme, of traditional tribute at the other extreme. 

* Injection and Removal. This refers to actions, always occluded in some way, taken by Observers and other Agents of extra-terrestrial or trans-dimensional institutions to inject or remove goods or services into (or less often, from) the Saskan economy for one reason or another. These actions are seldom if ever obvious for what they are. Agents are generally careful to concoct an elaborate scheme before interfering in this manner with huum and huum-plus social evolution. An injection might, for example, be a newly-found herb that helps to prevent (vaccinate against) spread of a certain deadly virus, while a removal might be aimed at preventing development of technology (say, for example, advanced internal combustion based on highly-contained use of carbon fuels) that the Agency has deemed too dangerous for use in the Enclosure.


Capitalism, Socialism, Wages, Exchange-Value

The Saskan Lands are by no means a highly evolved capitalist economy.  There are enclaves of abstracted exchange value, use of wages and so on, as well as prototypical and emerging capitalist situations.  Profit does motivate many players. But there is little sense in any of the predominant cultures of getting rich that is not tightly inter-related with guild or other institutional privilege and authority. Neither is it a highly evolved socialist economy.  There are aspects of the economy that focus on social solidarity and social needs as a primary motivation.

There is low-level industrial production. But the Agents have seen to it that rapid industrialization is unlikely to take off during their watch.

Wealth is understood by the vast majority to refer to the social standing of a family unit, an extended family unit, an alternative such tribal group, or a traditional hierarchy.  There are enough multiple threats to daily existence that consideration of using wealth solely to accumulate more wealth as a status symbol or means of acquiring power is  not something that seems sensible in most contexts.  Even in communities with a strong hierarchy, where the leaders are obviously being rewarded, they tend to be seen by the group members as protectors of the group who are being justly rewarded for that role.  And often they are in fact exactly that. More wise sheikh than feudal lord is the norm. 

The Riders are much more trade-oriented than the Heliops, who have very much a state-centrist approach to economics. The Riders are monopolists who have little sympathy for those trying to compete in their markets.  The mining communities of Eelan are voluntary Rider vassals. They operate in much the same fashion. The northern farmers and ranchers are likewise under the protection of the Authority and tend to work and think in much the same way. 

Much of the southern and far western lands are very agricultural and rural. And barqier than in the North.  Barter is prevalent there. The idea of wealth in the South is tied almost entirely to the success or failure of the harvest or the hunting and gathering. Especially considering the extremely labor-intensive form of agriculture and the catastrophic failure of much of the eco-system, this is entirely rational. There is a lot of naturally occurring mutual aid, as well as traditional hierarchies.

It is in the East, in the Outer Land provinces of the Runes of Bye, Nye Lands, Mobalbesq, and to a lesser extent, and in somewhat different ways in Arq, Pavanarune,  Eibar and the Kahilakol, where a mercantalist culture has solid roots. It is common for shipping-based enterprise, both on the seas and on the rivers, to pay their crews wages in cash, for example.  The managers of these enterprises have a sharper sense than do many others in the Saskan Lands of the advantages of buying low and selling high.

To the annoyance of both Riders and Heliops, the Outlanders encourage competition between Inns and so on seeking to buy fresh seafood and other aquatic products.  It is only in these areas where things resembling free enterprise, insurance and credit can be found, at least in embryo, to any widespread extent. For the same reasons, it is really only in these provinces where we find something resembling companies of entrepreneurs. These may bear a resemblance in some readers’ minds to pirates. They may not be tied to any specific guildhall or other institution, not even to a secret society. Gambling culture is not uncommon in the East. 

Aligned and coordinated to a degree with the criminal pastiche of the Kahilafolk, easterners tend to make up the bulk of hired mercenaries when trouble comes knocking, giving the region as a whole something of a swashbuckling élan.

 
Currencies

To facilitate exchange of goods, the main Saskan powers — the Authority and the Riders Guild — long ago began to mint coins.  Eventually, a form of paper money evolved as well, though it has more the character of transferable Letters of Credit than currency notes. Such letters tend to be used only by larger, more urbanized enterprises and for more permanent wholesale relationships. 

The busy folk of Byenung, including through the Night Hall networks, have also realized the value of a more abstracted kind of exchange. Ever mindful of the dangers of annoying Borded or Beshquohuk too much, they have refrained from minting their own specie. They have however, developed a whole set of institutions, relying as usual on the bewildering complex Byenung legal system, who act as guarantors for letters of credit. These in turn, have had a mass appeal in certain areas. The Byenung authorities have permitted limited runs of such credit markers to be imprinted on materials less flimsy than vellum and other expensive paper-like products, typically in small denominations. 

The Rider and Heliop coin-based currencies are completely inter-changeable and carry the same odd denominations. The value of coins is always relative to their size. There are universal terms for each of the coin sizes. Given the multi-lingual nature of the Saskan Lands, as well as the various images that have been stamped on them over the centuries, the coins have a wide range of alternative and local names. They tend to remain in use for long periods of time, down to the point where the images can no longer even be discerned.

Letters of Credit can be for almost any amount. Typically for amounts that are considerable simple multiples of the largest coins. They carry an expiration date set at issuance, after which point no further names of authorized carriers may be inscribed on them. This applies to the instruments floated in Byenung as well. An LoC can be used only by the carrier whose name was last inscribed on it. These names are added each time a transfer is made and the previous carrier’s name crossed-through. If there is no longer enough space to add another name, it is not uncommon to write in the margins of the document.  Obviously, this is far from a foolproof method, as a thief merely needs to write their name on the document and convince someone that it -- and they --  are legit.

The hard Byenung credits, on the other hand, are in denominations just slightly greater than the largest coins, plus a few larger amounts. Like the Rider and Fatunik coins, they are provided in a bewildering array of amounts. 

The Aybet is the traditional basic unit of currency in the Lands. But nowadays most folks refer to currency in Shan units.

Denominations of Byenung chits

Byenung hard credits are called chits. They have a variety of alternative names. Common amounts are described as follows. They are always referenced with the -chit afterwards, like nit-chit, hart-chit, ent-chit, to make it clear that Byenung specie, usually carved wooden or crafted as jewelry, is being referred-to.

Nit-chit	7 Aybet        	20 Shan      		7/1   	or  20/3
Kut-chit   	7 1/2 Aybet      25 Shan      		9/1   	or  25/3
Hart-chit	10 Aybet          30 Shan     		10/1   	or  30/3
Ent-chit:  	16 2/3 Aybet    50 Shan     		16+2/1 or  50/3
Cue-chit  	20 Aybet          60 Shan     		20/1   	or  60/3
Sup-chit	33 1/3 Aybet    100 Shan     		33+1/1 or 100/3
Long-chit  	100 Aybet        300 Shan     		100/1  	or 300/3


 
Exchange Rates, Prices, Money Supply

(Needs more...)

Guild-related prices are set centrally everywhere except in the Outer Lands, though this is subject to both good communications and a willingness to obey the center. Prices of agricultural goods fluctuate from season to season. Open-air markets usually permit open bargaining. In Fatunik areas where the authorities 'suggest' certain price ranges and in the South the powerful agricultural co-ops exert peer pressure to normalize prices. 

Money supply is directed by what are effectively central banks and mints in Borded and Beshquohuk, with the Byenung Board of Accountable Governance for the Oversight of Fair Trade and the Security of Exchange, working with the Night Hall, acting as an important central bank as well. The Byenung Board doesn’t issue currency, but they do collect it, along with other rarities, as they call them, and hold them as backing for their letters of credit and their hard chits.  Whether they actually have hoarded enough to fully pay out should there ever be a run on chits is not known. 

There is nothing like a stock exchange. Investments in a shipping adventures are handled directly with the concerned parties in the East/ The Night Hall network facilitates such communications.  A rough kind of commodities market occurs in several southern and eastern locales when ships arrive in port, at fall harvest time and in mid-spring, when buyers arrive to bid for goods, grain, herbs, when large shipments arrive at key river cities, and so on. The largest ones occur in Borded, Qurol, Rutónik, Byenung, Selaron, Morilly and Ingar. Agricultural prices can vary for vegetables and fruits, but grain prices are set centrally and, to a large extent, grain is itself a kind of currency.

            <Title>The Old Mill Cooperative</Title>
            <Text>A group of “hill country” people, from the villages and towns of The Weir Lands, Eelan and Oknott who work at a mill grinding flour, corn and other grains.  The mill is powered by a water wheel on the upper Pavan, about two keys east of the main north-south path connecting the 3 provinces. 
They are a combination of mixed and non-mixed sentients, all fully huum in appearance. 
As part of the work they do producing flours, for baking, brewing and for mixing s’lah, they interact with a number of guilds, inns, breweries, brooder-homes and other enterprises throughout the western provinces and into the center, especially the Toons of Qurol and Bordakol.  They are major suppliers to the Festival of the Full Moons.
The Mill itself is connected in a larger syndicate to a series of farms along the Upper Pavan. This is the foundation for a political movement that has a certain degree of support in High Weir, Eelan Toon and Mabhakol that might be called “Rider Syndicalism” or the “Free Riders Movement”.   The Mill workers collective and the broader syndicate are heavily infiltrated by the Circle of Fives, a more or less revolutionary organization with ties to various movers-and-shakers like the chaos-anarchy of Jesse K, certain elements of the Reform Movements in Byenung and the Isle of Nye Lands, some High Weir “royalists”, and certain more-or-less “mystical” organizations centered around Low Weir and Barbol.   
Along with their regular work and their occasional forays into politics, the Old Mill Comrades live in a sort of large extended family, with children being raised collectively for the most part. They also take pride in putting on a show at the Festival, prior to the Dance.  This is usually a funny musical number.  
The Mill Workers tend to specialize in various skills as part of their production work, and as producers of the show for the Festival, but these roles are fluid and it is not unusual for them to change over time. The roles include, but are not limited to:
* Grinder — overseeing the running and maintenance of the grinding wheel
* Winnower — prepare the various grains for grinding
* Packager — make, mend and fill bags and crates for delivery
* Runner — handle communications with farmer-producers and with customer-consumers
* Dealer — usually the more senior members, arrange barter or cash transactions, handle financial affairs / business relationships / recruitment
* Elder -- usually hold other roles too; responsible for handling conflicts within the group and for some aspects of instruction/training of new members, children
The members address each other using a collection of words like “comrade” that have the sense of “camarada” and “comadre” or “copadre” and “compadre”, which is to say, “bed-fellow”, “co-mother”, “co-father”, “good-friend” and so on and typically follow that with a role title, using a proper name only needed to distinguish a difference.
When preparing or putting on a show, they use role-names associated with that work rather than with mill work.  So this would be something like “Dear Elder Friend of the Lighting”,  “Co-Parent of the Costumes”, and so on.  Gender specification is fluid and can be vague, as in most cultures of the western provinces, but not strictly codified, as in the central provinces.

            <Title>In the Garden - Scene 3</Title>
            <Synopsis>Barkippers from Beyond the Edge</Synopsis>
            <Text>Master Kirill rode on the Jax’s shoulder while B'arqo slunk along behind.  As they passed the long bar on their way towards the back of the bar room, B'arqo cast a studious eye on the cetantionishy squad of barkeeps.
Visitors expect to encounter the unexpected in the Land Between Two Rivers. It is a land of contrasts, a melting pot of cultures, languages and species and a relatively safe bulwark for enterprise, agriculture and trade. 
At the Inn of the Full Moons, deep within the Bazaar on the ‘starry’ side of the rebellious town of Ríkila, one would expect to meet the unexpected. Nonetheless, few things are quite as striking as the first sight of the barkeeps at the Full Moons. 
In a world where huum-sints have evolved from many special cross-pollinations, in a time when science and superstition merge and mix to such a degree that distinctions between the two are largely conceptual, it could still be startling to encounter, to put it poetically, if not quite correctly, a fish out of water.  

To be more precise, if less poetic:  an octopus-person out of water.  Much less six of them forming a kind of conga line rapidly serving drinks to a busy crowd of clientele. 
When a visitor orders a bowl of s’lah at the long bar of the Full Moons, it’s likely to be served by a team of multi-brained eight-tentacled denizens of the deep, creatures whose DNA is as much 40% from the order Octopada. Those patient enough to listen might even enjoy, along with their spicy intoxicating drink, a lugubrious story or two regarding the epic migration of the Tetricus family from their homeland, which they claim to be on the other side of the world, that is, from beyond the Edge of It All. They’ll tell tall tales of having traveled through many oceans to arrive the Bay of Bar and up the River Pavan. Settling at last, of all of the s’lah joints in all the lands, at this particular curve of the Ring of Saskantinon.

A lot of sensible sints laugh at their stories.  Obviously, nothing can simply swim into the Lurabar from out there, from Beyond the Edge, Where Nothing Lives. Every educated sint knows that the navigable world-ocean ends where the Great Wall of Fire meets the Cataracts of Doom, right near the Edge.  

B'arqo allowed a brief smile as he pondered the common wisdom.  He recalled what he’d learned from his years sailing the Forgh with a crew of practical, if somewhat piratical, Nyenan mariners, regarding the Familia Tetricus.  He’d learned for example, that not entirely unlike the most hard-core Heliops among the puros, who prefer to keep their sexes binary and separate, the male and female members of the Tetricus clan tended by and large to avoid each other, except when mating. 
Unlike the puros sun worshipers, though, who do so for religio-poltical as well as economic reasons, the story B'arqo’d learned was that the eight-leggers did so because the Seff lasses had the habit of occasionally dining on the fellows after sex. 

As they made their way through the crowded room, he quietly shared some rare linguistic and sintological observation for the Lookie’s entertainment and education. The Jax nodded knowingly as B'arqo explained, 
“They have big eyes, short torsos, over-sized craniums, eight nearly sentient-in-themselves limbs each with a myter-long arm-span, not to mention a cozy habitat of tightly co-inhabiting a space. Tetricusi octopods make for a formidable bar-keeping crew.  They exhibit huum characteristics like air-breathing gills in a more or less huum-like facial configuration.  Three legs are used to stand and perambulate. They have very basic vocal chords, and, at least in some cases, even some body hair.  They typically communicate in a squishy-sounding Eibar, with the Growlshy accents common to sea creatures of the Krbshanana. They tend to use a lot of gesticulations as well plus various colorations that only they seem to understand.”

The Jax waved his arms sympathetically, or jokingly, or in confusion, which made Master Kirill’s ride bumpy. The proprietor reached out and bopped B'arqo on the head with his stick and bellowed, “Can it, canine.  Nobody likes a know-it-all. ”
Doing his best to approximate the Seff accent as he passed right by the end of the bar, B'arqo murmured loud enough to be heard by the barfellow at that end, “Hey man, cool scars you got. How’s the wife?” 
This earned him a squishy chortling sound in reply, along with a gesture and a color display, which he thought probably meant either “Ha-ha” or “Fook off” or maybe both, followed by a spray of salty-smelling water in his general direction.</Text>

Iohane and Henqu seem heroic and brave, as told in Birakay's popular song.
But when they get into trouble with the Authority, the Riders Council abandons them.

&gt; &lt;  Main events, resolutions, actions in this scene.

Borded protects the Ring. Beshquohuk feeds it sacrifices. The Riders are ordered arrested.

Finish --&gt; The Riders Council has a tumultuous meeting.


Timeline

A retrospective that builds around the lyrics to Birakay's song extolling Henqu and Iohane.

The order to arrest them goes out in synch with the order to arrest Stanley, so this chapter ends a few days before the events in Chapter 1.

Beauty

The simplicity of Henqu's song, the strength and justice of Iohane's song.

Humor

Bloviating leaders in Borded as compared to the honesty and integrity of the Riders themselves.

Truth

The ruling classes always stick together against the proles.

Impact

Like Ravel's Bolero, the theme is repeated in various ways and begins to build towards a trance like culmination.

Undersea civilizations

Role in Story

Multiple sentient undersea civilizations exist within the Krbsh Sea and beyond.

Little is known about them and they have little interaction with surface dwellers. Fishing expeditions from Saskantinon are aware of beings in the deep who sometimes compete with them. Stories abound, but there is little fact.

The Remari Islands contain life-forms (birds, dragons, reptiles mostly), some sentient, some not, who are familiar with and interact with the Krbshnana and vice-versa. Really need a separate card for Remari Islanders.

            <Title>Malavorra</Title>
            <Text>Malavorra
Unknown • Low Weir

Role in Story
The living, breathing personification of the River-Soul of Settan tradition.  A warrior queen  of giant size, even those who don't hold to the Southern beliefs consider her to be something like a force of nature. A guru, a totem, a living legend.

Referred to as the Jexan Mother by a sub-group Jexan Returners.  Holds various honorifics in the southern Lands.

Goal
To strengthen the role of women, girls, female gender in the Saskan Lands.
To deepen the knowledge and influence of the Dauni Vakasaqua. Bring the stories of the River-Soul into more lives, emphasizing the critical importance of having deep spiritual ties to the land, the earth, the waters in order to prevent catastrophe. 
Physical Description
Very tall, very big, very curvy. Expressively feminine appearance. Combative when necessary.
Some raven DNA.  Speaks all the languages of the region, including those known in Aranzen and Wesshewen with great facility.
 
Personality
Falstaffian. Fond of s’lah, of which she is a provider of a potent herbal blend. 
Has had multiple lovers and many children. Gets along fine with huum but is especially fond of sints.

Occupation
One of the leading personalities of Low Weir's mostly matriarchal society, Malavorra is an important political figure in the western lands. Along with having a near-divine status in the eyes of many, she is also well-known throughout the southern lands as a tireless and pragmatic coordinator of free and independent Dauni Vakasaqua collectives. The free southern Dauni Vakasaqua are a self-governing member organization, a federation à la Mondragon.

Habits/Mannerisms
Handles a wide variety of concerns relating to Low Weir, her large extended family, her friends and lovers, the broader political and military situations, and the business of the Dauni Vakasaqua collectives.  Works hard.  Plays hard.  Travels a great deal.  Makes a big impression anywhere she goes.  Not subtle.  A strong but fair negotiator.  Has numerous gifts of healing as part of her Dauni Vakasaqua kit.

Background
Nobody knows how old Malavorra is or how she came to be. Many simply regard her as a goddess. Legends, songs about her abound.  Folks can be surprised when they actually meet her, having assumed the tales about her are fanciful. She herself has little recollection of how she came to be. 

It is a dream-like memory of emerging, coalescing out of chaos, growing and evolving with a wide variety of huum and animal influences. She is often drawn to the river and participates in many of the popular ancient Settan rituals. She ages very, very slowly but is not Terrapina. 

 She was created as part of multiple Agency interventions several centuries ago.  She doesn’t know this and the Agency records on it have been obscured, tampered with, and damaged.

Internal Conflicts
Being long-lived brings its own kind of suffering. She has seen many of her acquaintances, friends, lovers and children pass away. She feels the pain behind the Catastrophe like a personal event. Though she disagrees with their cosmology, their politics, and their gender culture, she appreciates the concern that Heliops have about preventing its recurrence. 

External Conflicts
Some factions within the Heliocastronic Center see her as a threat due to her enormous popularity, not only in the western and southern lands, and amongst females in particular.  They spread counter-propaganda aimed at smearing her reputation. 

Notes
Likely interesting to have flashbacks based on Malavorra's dreams and recollections.

In Ingur, Calley Coola (name? Ugh, also don't think we've ever seen this character before?) takes stock of the situation, works to sabotage the Lorhnites and provide intelligence and tactical support to the Volunteers and the Northern Army of Resistance. (See her bio.).  A dark character, she provides a dose of cynical optimism and some insight into the shadowy origins of the Ilyushan. (Need to work in some intro material on CC earlier.)

Tonedo sends out instructions to ignite the wall of fire.  In response to Tonedo's threats, the Eelani blow their dams, sending water flooding into the western sections of the Fatunik provinces. Angry and undeterred, Tonedo sets the Kahilabarbakol on fire. 

In the wake of Showan's shocking death, with Kam the Bull and Giltraq at his side, who inspire Volunteers and some Tagabant to go over to the Resistance, Gallex of the Nye leads a mixed Resistance force northwards to attack the Ilyushan, carrying the banner of Showan Nywing. Fatunik Volunteers and some Tagabant are drawn away from the pogrom program.  Bloodthirsty Kahila set on revenge are drawn towards the unified resistance. A large Byenung militia is formed under Showan's banner. 

The Rider Regulars defend the northern border against incursions from Wesshewen, then turn east to liberate the eastern provinces from the Ilyushan invasion. (Need some specific characters, specific action here.)

Following the rout of the Jaxen, Otto Trucent leads a group of rebel Riders and Freeborn Eelani to  join the fight to repel the Ilyushan invasion, their forces meeting up with the Rider Regulars into an impressive and thunderous calvary charge across the plains.

All of these forces encounter difficult terrain of water and fire.
&gt; &lt;  Main events, resolutions, actions in this scene.

Cracks in the wall of tradition spread throughout the Lands, with severe repercussions in Beshquohuk and Borded. (What events are happening there?) The resistance not only lives, it has numerous rhizomes that are spreading in every direction.

Stanley (still in captivity? Need to get his story arc straightened out) and Birakay agree to join up with the pollinators distributing the jars. Birakay does not join in the fighting, taking up the position of the Dauni Vakasaqua that pollinating and seeding the lands are more vital to survival. His main task at this point is freeing Stanley and keeping from being assassinated.

Finish --&gt;  There is an epic conjunction of full moons as the green comet re-appears. Super high tide. It starts to rain. It turns into a torrential downpour.  There is flooding in many areas along both rivers and in the weir lands. The Green Lady sends sparkles towards the boys. 

 Timeline

Continue from Cards 33 and 34. (Check for continuity regarding Gallex, Kam, "Calley Coola"... Need to have introduced these characters and told some of their story earlier).
Beauty

There is a multiplicity of living patterns that holds the world together. A devastating flood results in fertile land. A forest fire clears the way for regenerated growth.
Humor

See the opening scene of Shakespeare's "The Comedy of Errors". Use a pastiche on it to describe the arrival of a team carrying jars to a Fatunik town, the song of the voyage, which captivates the listeners, though it does not win them mercy.  Perhaps this occurs in Beshquohuk?
Truth

A beautiful main entrance has layers of transition. 

Impact

A great sloshing about of yin energy.

            <Title>Archetypes and Myths</Title>
            <Text>It doesn’t hurt to create characters who fit archetypal roles. Its a Jungian thing. This helps to match the story up to peoples dreams, to their innate sense of language and myth and so on. It’s why each generation seems to produce the same “type” of actors, who excel in specific roles. 

Getting too archetypal is not much fun, but being aware of archetypes and their influence can help to develop a character, to understand what kind of boundaries they should have, to get a sense of what motivate them.

Some of the simpler, best known ones are:

	●	Young man (or …) on the rise. A little dumb, maybe, but plucky. We want to see this character win, at least eventually. Yang version of “young woman tempted”.
	●	Young woman (or …) tempted. Pure of heart, cute as a bug. Yin version of “young man on the rise”.
	●	The Imp. The clever and resourceful child. Comes in both “good” and “evil” flavors.
	●	The sex goddess (or …).  Yin version of “the hunk”.
	●	The hunk (or …). Yang version of “the sex goddess”.

Next rank includes:

	●	Wounded soldier (fighter, player, …) going back in for redemption.
	●	The troubled sexpot.
	●	The lovable fop.
	●	The court jester.
	●	The wise grandfather (or…).

Then there are ones that I’ll be dancing around with a good bit:

	●	Magic dwarves and elves.
	●	Tricksters.
	●	Sidekicks.
	●	Talking animals.
	●	Spinsters / witches / wise old women.
	●	Wizards.
	●	Falstaffs (jolly gourmands).
	●	Misers.

Especially in film, there are strong expectations regarding who “wins” and who “loses”. If I mess with that, there needs to be a reason why.



Mythologically-speaking, we have a world I which enough time has passed that a working post-industrial, post-planetary apocalypse mythology (or several of them) have had time to mature. Of course they kind of echo the situation in our modern world, with the overall story line arc taking us in the direction of a Gaia-centered, Black Elk speaks kind of viewpoint. 

Dig into the distinction between reason and science. 

----

See Appendix of Dune. That's the level of depth I want to have.
There are as many as 25 sequels to Dune. His son wrote a bunch of them.
Herbert himself wrote 6 Dune books (5 sequels).

Herbert followed Campbell's "The Hero's Journey" very closely.

            <Text>
We literally rise out of hole. The first balloons rise. 

The first birds return to Saskantinon as the ship returns to harbor.  

Let’s get a butterfly resuscitation theme going too. But keep it occluded, mysterious. 

Jax Remanj starts a movement to collaborate with Dauni Vakasaqua and Mobalbesqian engineers. The “Free Jax” movement grows and develops.

Engineering bees back into life, turning the “scary bugs” motif around in a fun surprise. The “aliens” (Agency) are a hopeless mess, they caused some of the main problems and support some of the most reactionary forces in the Lands. A faction of the home-grown “enemy” (Jaxen/AI) are more forward-thinking than most of the biological life-forms.  This is a surprise twist -- bit of a slow burn the way I have it set up so far, but at least it turns the traditional Gamma World version of that story around. I also like the Seth MacFarlane-ish approach to the celestial overlords -- the "Star Trek" folk did intervene -- and fucked everything up.

===

A Mobalbesqan naval flotilla that includes our intrepid voyagers returning from Wing Island stops at the Setta Delta to pick up advisors from The Runes of Bye, then at Selaron to drop off supplies for the defense of Ríkila, along with other trade goods. 

As the ships approach the Bay of the Pavan, they spot creatures pouring into the Sea from the Forg and the Ilyushan.   

The landing at the Towers of the Pavan Bar is done surreptiously and quietly, with many of the non-huum sints and allies recruited from the realm of the Delphine Queen swimming up the river towards Ingar rather than exposing themselves to detection by Heliops at the Pavan Bars.

Warriors led by Mikel Moballeq (?) and/or maybe Barqalod (?), recruited in the Outer Lands, are moving northwards, starting to arrive in the Pavan Bay area at the same time that the ships are arriving. 

Local authorities examine the documents provided by Luvcando the Shanowan,while  the Sea Watch at the Pavan Bars is thrown into shock when they see ravens flying towards Ingar.  

They are even more appalled when gulls and pigeons start arriving on the docks, arguing and carrying on, as they do.

===

Continuing to explore the underground tunnels of the western lands, plans are revealed for gliders, kites, balloons, parachutes. 

All those kinds of things that have been carefully denigrated and misdirected by the Agents have been subtly encouraged by the dissident Jaxen.

            <Text>
Card Number: 12

This chapter opens a door into the Jaxen world. Literally. It is a flashback that provides a peek at the Event in Ríkila, with a particular lens into the world of the Empafarasi.  It's a bit of trick. We're still not getting into details about the Event. This b-roll is really about the Jaxen.


The POV is probably excerpts from Remanj's report to his pod.

When the Empafarasi met the rabble in Ríkila, told thru the story of long-lost brothers, Dex and Biff... 

Biff  is both a cat and a cat burglar. 
Dex is both a cat and catty. 

Twin boybeks, they were unknown to each other, having been separated at a young age, Dex having been sold off by his impoverished parents to a farming and foraging team based in the northlands. He fled towards the western mountains after the farm was attacked by bandits. Eventually rescued by Empafarasi riders. 

He became a member of a Empafarasi unit responsible mainly for patrolling the hills to insure villagers are safe from fons and on the lookout for incursions from the Krunkinotto.  He seeks glory and is teased by his comrades for being a bit of a shit-head. He is strong and quick, to his credit, but without a lot of fortitude.  Good in an encounter, but not on a long march.  Despite his tendency to tire out fairly quickly, he has a strong constitution and tends to heal quickly when hurt.

He's never been examined and claims to be 100% bek, but is sometimes (usually jokingly) called "Dex the Cat" etc. by his comrades.  His foresight and perception are sharp. He has slight powers of heightened hearing and seeing, with a mild ability to foresee possibilities clearly -- although he doesn't himself realize these are enhanced powers.  

His twin brother, called Biff, whom he just barely recollects, is similar in all ways, but has lived most of his life in Ríkila, falling in with a number of bitamin outfits there and making a living mostly as a successful cat burgler, and running a number of confidence schemes. 


During the initial Empafarasi interventions in Ríkila, following the uprising there, Dex was sent with an advanced team to scope things out. They arrived in an official capacity to parlay with the various factions and thus were quite visible to watching eyes of all types.  

Biff picked up on their similar appearance and used this as a means to carry out various cons.  Following complaints from locals, Biff was eventually apprehended by Empafarasi agents and taken to High Weir under guard for judgement by the highland court.  That was how Dex and Biff are re-united.


Time to get funny in some fairly obvious ways, and to have fun with a “Tale of Two Cities” kind of theme.


The Jaxen-folk come into the story on both sides. 

Dex has a friendship with a Jax (yes, Remanj again, younger but looks exactly the same) that is turning into a love story, though he is not sure yet if that is the case. Remanj is the first person (of a sort) who seems to appreciate him for who he is.  Then Dex begins to inadvertently 'turn' a Jax, which continues once Biff comes into the picture.

The Jax was programmed to infiltrate the Kahila underground. It mistakenly is trying to hook up with Dex instead, who is a lone ranger/anarcho—cowboy Robin Hood kind of thief only tied to the Kahila loosely.

They go through a number of doors together. Not sure why yet, but I want lots of doors and passage ways in this chapter.


Biff had training in High Weir regarding Jax infiltration techniques and Jax technology. He is familiar with their tunneling capabilities.  

He knows a lot more about the true nature of the machinic life forms than do most Outlanders. But he had little to no actual interaction with them in the Weir Lands.

He becomes fascinated by Dex’s Jaxen friend. And also develops an emotional, possibly sexual attachment as well.  Remanj is not entirely clear on the distinction between the twins and tries to conceptualize it in the framework of Jaxen cloning, which triggers new algorithms to develop in his pod.  

A complicated but funny “Cyrano de Bergerac” story-line unfolds, where each twin unwittingly plays the Cyrano role to his brother's role as the lieutenant in love.

            <Title>Independent Healers Association</Title>
            <Text>IHA
Clinics in all major towns and some villages

Role in Story
An outpost of calm, healing and something like science. How characters get put back together after violent episodes.

Relationship to Other Organizations
Tend to remain neutral between large tribal organizations

Description
A service organization, they are funded in part by town offices since they provide a necessary role. Also take donations and volunteers. 

Roles of Members
Organized in something like a meritocratic hierarchy, with titles and gowns/banners/hats somewhat reminiscent of medieval universities, with an overlay of religious community garb. 

Prime Healers — top of the hierarchy, usually old and experienced, from a variety of specialties. Responsible for a certain geographic area, but travel a good bit.

Medico — basically a general practitioner. May have some skills in surgery as well. Mostly diagnoses and treatments with herbal concoctions and accupressure-type massage.

Mage Healer — rare, sints with powers of healing. Not necessarily associated with Mages Guilds.

Scanner — a mental health worker. May or may not also be a member of a “Detecting” agency

Haitchtoo — an assistant to a healer, at many levels of skill, may range from apprentices to clean-up crew. This term is said to reflect the sound a sick person makes. It may also be a legacy of an old acronym. 

Mullie — a medical researcher, more interesting in information gathering and experimentation than in treatment.  “Mulls” things over. Also a reference to the MUL.  

Currie — an independent, usually more traditional, “healer”, more common South of the Setta and in the hills, often associated with an Dauni Vakasaqua community. Some are members of the IHA and some are not. 

Types/Personalities of Members
Often thoughtful, almost monk-like, but some are gregarious and a bit crude.

Industrial, Economic or Cultural Role


Habits/Dress / Mannerisms of Members
Their symbol is a red dot or sphere. The number of dots reflects their role in the Association. More dots means higher-up.  
The obvious association here is with drops of blood. The IHA — though this is not widely known — was initiated by Agents with strong ties to the Martian Underground Labs (MUL), but that is a whole other story…

Background


Internal Conflicts
Some IHA members with a strong agricultural background are interested in evolution and genetics research. They have begun to suspect that the variations in geno/pheno in the Saskan Lands are not entirely natural. This exacerbates some of the existing huum/puro vs. mixed-sint conflicts that rattle pretty much all Saskan communities. 

External Conflicts
The Bugs have tried infiltrating the IHA from time to time in order to gather info on sint bio-chemistry and so on. They are generally unsuccessful as the Medicos are quite good at spotting Jaxen. 
Some parts of the Agency occasionally try to interfere as well, especially in work looking into evolution and genetics, though this itself has internal conflicts due to the IHA ties to the MUL.

Description
Need to work on the math a bit, but I'd like to have it so the appearance of the two moons is just the opposite of their reality. Sella appears larger in the sky because it is closer, when in fact Endor -- which is further away -- is larger.

Card Number: 31
+ / -  Main conflicts in this scene.

Kam's encounter with the Traveling Sisters comes back to haunt him after witnessing the Troubles in Beshquohuk. The Candlemakers are watching him closely.

A workmate (who? A Lorhnite probably) is on to Kam's cloven feet and denounces him as a crypto-basherbazh. 

As the political atmosphere heats up, he hops a barge of traveling tinkers and flees towards the Outerlands.

&gt; &lt;  Main events, resolutions, actions in this scene.

Tell most of Kam's story here (see his bio), with some appropriate foreshadowing earlier so it's not a total shot in the dark. 

As uproar envelops the northern lands, many groups are on the move. Kam encounters Sleeths, Arns, Devosh and Botos during his journey to the Outerlands. (How so? Are they that far North?) Form the eastern borderlands, they are fleeing the Ilyushan invasion. 

When traveling along the Pavan, he encounters Rillbeck the Runner, who makes fun of everything, but is also in a hurry to avoid the troubles.

Kam also observes all types of non-sentient animals either being moved to safety or fleeing on their own, lots of frightened farmers and farm-hands worried that the troubles will further disrupt an already fragile agriculture, hunters, shepherds, ranchers and their flocks fleeing from the east.

Finish --&gt; A group of botos negotiate with the tinkers, offering trinkets from the river for news of affairs among the huum. 

 Timeline

Following on from Card 27, as the situation in the Fatunik provinces intesifies.     
Beauty

Sleeths perform a fan dance for Kam, communicating that intelligent life arrived long before and will survive long after the huum. Kam gets the idea that may be close to immortal. They predict an imminent arrival. They let him know they are heading to board a Komexol ship in Barqton.
Humor

Sleeths perform a fan dance for Kam..  Their dance pokes fun at Bud Starga and Jesse K.
Truth

Actions have consequences. All the life forms in Saskan Lands are troubled, except maybe the Sleeth.

Impact

Touch the earth. Feel the rock. Feel the water. Watch the trees. A fire warms us. Reach from the utter inner stillness of a calm beating heart, out into the great cosmos, connecting all things together.

+ / -  Main conflicts in this scene.

Kam is a devoted and faithful Sun worshipper, but has doubts. Instead of a carpenter (a bit too obvious) let's have him be a shepherd / herder/ranch-hand. He becomes increasingly conflicted about the treatment of Fons, especially after meeting Ramona, who is a vegetarian. 

The main conflict has to do with the unfolding of neurotic Fatunik ideology, opening up to the Other, even and perhaps especially unconsciously, via an indirect discourse.

Northerners, and traditional Fatuniks in particular, prefer gender-neutral presentation for non-hierarchs, but the Traveling Sisters joyfully ignore that. More neurotic conflicts for Kam, who naturally has a very masculine bearing.

&gt; &lt;  Main events, resolutions, actions in this scene.

Carrots are one key to underground economy, even though they are not the main staple for rabbits and rabbit-sints. In any case, rabbits reproduce quickly and are tasty. Take a look at the politics and economics of meat-eating in a land where agriculture is difficult, at least a few animals can talk, and more than a few human-appearing sentients are part-animal in DNA make-up.

Wolves and other predators, including the shadowy Ilyushan and the metallic Jaxen, add a challenging twist to the story. It's not simply about "evil meat-eating huum".

Kam's story... As reported by Ramona, who has a thing for him.

* Kam was part of a Watch team that escorted SPQ to Juuj or Beshquohuk, or was part of the team that arrested him in Ríkila.

* Encountered Biff and Dex while in Ríkila -- they are the proprietors of the Full Moons. He was responsible for informing them, asking for their cooperation.  This conversation touched on some of the background on the uprising in Ríkila, building up Kam's already-existing but hidden sympathies for outlanders and southerners.

* He also encounters Ramona while in Ríkila. She asks him about the northern song cycles. Is she an agent for the Traveling Sisters? Maybe...

* He develops regrets about participating in the persecution of Stanley

* Have his story intersect, replay, remind various events in Act One:
	- Arrest of Stanley
	- Funny stuff going on in the Kahilabarbakol
	- More funny stuff going on in Juuj
	- Hauling Stan off to Beshquohuk
	- The execution of Henqu and Iohane during the Gleaming and the ensuing uprising
	- Assigned to Jivákala in preparation for combat with the Ilyushan. It will be a staging area and also is close enough to Borded to serve as a kind of warning to the Riders and other westerners not to fuck with the Fatunik Forces. Tonedo is aware of what is stirring out west.

MM and team make it Besh and attempt to rescue SPQ again, this time with help from Kam. But he still refuses to go, even though his life may be forfeit. In the course of the attempted break, MM discovers that her son Xavi Moballeq is also being held -- against his will. She and Bu'ruq spring him with Kam's help.

MM and Kam join forces, but SPQ does not want to be sprung just yet.

The Traveling Sisters not only have an ongoing interesting impact on Kam's story; they intersect with, remind us about the main storyline regarding Birakay and the New Song. And, yes, Ramona is one of their agents.

Finish --&gt; Kam talks to Stanley and discovers that Ramona is his sister.
Timeline

Action --&gt;  Replay of all the stuff, pretty much, in Act I, concluding with the current-time, where Kam has been assigned to guard SPQ in Beshquohuk as he prepares for presenting his Argument to the Center.
Beauty

Kam has the intensity of the younger shepherd in Caravaggio's famous nativity scene, The Adoration of the Shepherds. 
Humor

Kam is no dimwit. He calls out mental eroticism as an unworthy substitute for action. He understands homoerotic attractions directed his way, even if unsaid, and is smart enough to enjoy flirting back if a game is on, and compassionate enough to end it amicably if the game is too serious. 
Truth

The neurotic unfolds into the Other by means of a discourse of slips, dreams and witticisms.   
Impact

More so than a treacly version of compassion and kindness, mindfulness means having awareness of the perpetual flow of interdependent thoughts, even to the point of stopping us in our tracks to stare intently at their unfolding.

            <Text>KEY THEMATIC CONCEPTS for a modern story or game

HUMOR

In every culture, it is the comic writers and poets who were loved most widely and remembered most broadly.  We think some animals play and a few may even have a sense of humor.  Ravens, in particular, and probably dogs too.  But while all animals can writhe and/or cry out in pain, and some seem to have expressions for happiness and pleasure, it is humans and pretty much only humans, as far as we know, who laugh. 

And of course, the idea of a pack of dachshunds and chihuahuas leading a battle charge has to fit in there somewhere. :-) 

Have some fun. Let the reader/player have fun too!

CONCEPTS

There are some key concepts that anyone living in the real world in modern times is concerned with.  Finding ways to explore these themes in the story, in a meaningful way that leaves room for multiple interpretations and movements, would be a big win. 

These include:

* Love
* Ethics
* Self-sacrifice
* Duty
* Healing

"Do huum deserve to live on this planet that they have done so much to ruin?" -- pretty much the overarching philosophical theme of the epic.  What is this character doing (or not) to reverse the ecocide?

When working through characters, episodes and story arcs, but especially characters and episodes, include notes on these items. They have been added to the Character template. 



COMPLEX THEMATIC CONCEPTS: Psychology, Literature/Art, Culture, Philosophy

Zizek’s book on Hegel dives into a number of ideas for psychological, literary, cultural and philosophical themes that could be interesting to weave into the story. 

The idea of Enclosure resonates with the history of capitalism, of course, and has some obvious thematic weight along the lines of reading a story about a set of characters who are, more or less, invented/controlled by unseen observers.  The story itself kind of breaks down  the 4th wall — of authorship (who is telling/directing this story?), what is the role of the audience — as well as playing around with the structure of god/maker video games (can I, the player, reach a level where I can help to direct the course of the game?).

In terms of literary antecedents, these concepts resonate especially with works by Brecht and, to some extent, Kafka. In the same way the KS Robinson acknowledges his debt to Bogdanov, perhaps I can nod to Brecht and Kafka. And speaking of Bogdanov (and KS Robinson) I owe them a great debt of gratitude as well. Read up on the Proletcult stuff.  Re-read the piece in e-flux about cops and art.  Think about all the things I’ve tried to say in eRepublik via “SPQ” and “RFW” about détourning the game and see how I might incorporate that. For that matter, why not introduce SPQ himself as a character?

The Lands of Saskantinon play with post-apocalyptic genres, situating itself in the zookeeper kind of style. Humanity (and other sentient life on Earth) is saved (from the Flood, canonically speaking, that is, the ecocide) only through the benevolent oversight of a big Other (the Agency). But that is also when it gets interesting.  The Heliops fear the big Other, while denying that it actually exists and creating a symbolic appearance (petit objet a) where the impossible resides, using the most obvious metaphor of all, the literal big Other — the Sun.  The divers stargazers are more Kantian — understanding the phenomenological gap in noumenal terms, that it is something out there, which is fundamentally not part of phenomena as we know it, rather something else, mysteriously other, to be believed in, perhaps on faith alone, etc.  The twist is that the big Other is entirely real — in the sense that it does actually exist — but (ha-ha, surprise double-twist) they are incompetent and themselves filled with contradiction. 

Our Saskan Hegelians, Derridadaists and Badiouamaticians express varieties of understanding the not-all of the Enclosure in more materialist terms:
Hegelians as a twist that will reveal the benevolent nature of the Universe, 
Derridadaists: as a difference that reflects our own sentient split, possibly illusionary, between subject and object, a
Badioumaticians: as the harbinger of an event that will change everything in the blink of an eye, 
…and so on and so forth.

His thoughts on the development of western music are also intriguing. This might help to flesh out the bard song and song cycle thematic elements, colors of the story.    
Likewise, multiple references to jokes, iconic performances would certainly be in order if I wanted to acknowledge Zizek his own bad self as an influence... 

How to work this stuff into my work methods?  Let’s try adding some stuff to character and scene templates as reminders along these lines.

+ / -  Main conflicts in this scene.

As Beshquohuk Town erupts in chaos, Stanley has been put in the Box, where he makes his case to the Authority.

After being rebuffed in Borded (where did this happen? -- Maybe put it in here. Also need to show Waleran learning dire news about Birakay, sending notice to B'arqo, who is on his way to Byenung to parley with the Night Hall. Probably move scenes of Tonedo condemning Birakay to this chapter).  

Waleran travels on to High Weir.  The Lords of the Mistral Tower refuse Waleran's appeal as well, arguing that the Jaxen threat outweighs that of Ilyushan, much less Stanley's Argument.

Waleran reveals to the "wind lords"  a Green strategy regarding the total transformation of Saskan society, which can be triggered by the adoption of Stanley's proposals. Seeing the bigger picture, the Empafarsi are convinced and join the cause.

&gt; &lt;  Main events, resolutions, actions in this scene.

The uprising spreads.  News from the Northeast gets worse.

SPQ issues an impassioned public plea from Beshquohuk for new thinking, while Waleran makes a similar appeal to the Empafarsi. 

Stanley openly opposes the fear of flying and calls for radical system change. This sends shock waves through the Agency as well as the Authority.  The ripples in the Deep Pool continue to spread.  A date is set for the formal Arguments to commence.

Finish --&gt;  Consternation aboard the starship ASS (really?) Visitor.
Timeline

Action --&gt; Following from chapters 10 and others in Act 1. Some time passes after the Gleaming. Maybe a quick time lapse is needed to indicate some of that. 
Beauty

The Mistral (?) Tower of the Empafarasi.
Humor

The gods must be idiots.
Truth

Seeing the vast big picture is the way to wisdom. 
Impact

Intellectual. This is when the huum and sints begin to seize their destiny, the beginning of the end of the Agency's mission. The twilight of the gods.

            <Title>Kirill Geckter</Title>
            <Text>Kirill Geckter
32 • Ríkila
Title: Master of the Manifold Ways

Role in Story
A comical character due to their small size but large personality.  One of B'arqo’s connections to the underworld — especially the “thieves guilds” or “bitamin” in the local vernacular.  Kirill is one of the overtly “animal” characters, being 40% gekkota (gecko) and proud of it.  I am curious to see if I can play a “raven’s game” in the story-telling, in the sense that the sexual identity of characters becomes apparent (a) only once they reach a position of authority or leadership and (b) only once they choose to reveal it. This will be a pervasive characteristic of the fantasy world, but one that will hopefully come as something of a surprise to readers.  I see Kirill as a means to introduce this concept. 
Goal
Kirill helps to reveal two important social organizations within the world: the Free Innkeepers/Hosteliers and their relationships to the Riders of Borded; and the varied world of the bitamin organizations, through his leadership of one called the Annaki Intimi, ranging from those basically supporting the resistance of oppressed species and poor classes, in some sense the representatives of the “rabble” in Saskantinon, to those merely obsessed with power, riches, lust and so on. 
Physical Description
40% gekko, with greenish skin, thick torso merging into the head with little neck. No eyelids, long tongue that is used to wet the eyeballs. Short by huum standard, huge for a gecko; about 3 feet / 1 meter.  Dresses extravagantly with bandoleros and a cavalier hat. Something of a “Puss in Boots” stereotype — need to make sure there are enough distinctions, and that the character is sympathetic enough to not simply be a parody.  Short huum-like limbs. No tail.
Personality
Commanding in a friendly way.  Always has an eye out for interesting acquisitions. 
Occupation
Owner/Proprietor of the Inn of the Full Moons in the rebellious town of Ríkila. Leader of the Annaka Intimi (“Master of the Manifold Ways”), a thieves guild that is closely tied to various rebel factions.  Senior consultant to the eastern free innkeeper bookkeeper fraction of the Free Hosteleries Cooperative Council. 
Habits/Mannerisms
Kind of a squeaky/chirpy voice. Likes to talk, hum and sing.  Knows multiple languages. Prefers warm temperatures.  Needs warm clothing if temps drop below (70 F); can suffer serious harm in freezing temps; fear of winter.  Moves very quickly, including walking backwards. Adept at climbing.  Tends to be active at night and sees well in the dark. Fruit &amp; honey are preferred diet. For protein, prefers to eat insects.  From a parthenogenic line that makes no distinction between sexes. Prefers the gender-neutral pro-nouns ze, hir, dey, dem. (Note: maybe develop equivalents in vernacular and use those in the text?)
Background
Like all gecko-sints in Kirill’s line, ze was abandoned at birth. Emerged from the egg in an underground tunnel inhabited by rebel rabbits (vegetarians), who helped to raise hir.  The legendary ALF leader Maatsuuv was one of hir mentors.  A quick wit, ability to move silently in many directions drew attention of some Annaki-affiliated hares, who recruited hir at a young age.  Ze eventually became appalled at their lack of devotion to the cause and disagreed with their intense hatred of all huum.  Some rough turns led to Kirill’s encounter with B'arqo at the Beet Farm, who later introduced hir to some Rider-Innkeeper elements in the eastern towns.  Kirill used a combination of skill and, umm, politics, to become the sole proprietor of the Full Moons.  Once established in a (semi-)legit business, ze founded the Annaka Intimi (roughly, “the band of siblings”) 
Internal Conflicts

Complicit in criminal affairs which leads to a never-ending soul-searching to find an ethical balance.
Highly intelligent and sympathetic to all, but often rejected by puros for being “too animal”

External Conflicts
Often in conflict with Fatunik authorities and compelled to call on influence with Riders for protection.
Also often in conflict with rival criminal gangs, and sometimes “on the hook” to do favors for those who aren’t criminals, but could expose hir. 
Legal work running the Inn is burdensome, some conflict with overwork vs. desire to live a more “natural” life in the countryside.
Story-lines
Opening scenes at the Full Moons in Ríkila.
Helps to organize the expedition to the Remari Islands.

            <Text>A group from the Devotees of the Purple Flower, an Dauni Vakasaqua cult centered in villages not far from Low Weir, circulated among the others, celebrating the awakening of the tree-spirits and bartering their trademark purple clothing and accouterments in exchange for food, drink, tools, news and new songs or stories.  

The widely-respected Riverside Actors Guild of Barbol, working together with a small group of bug-crossed villagers from the hilly Weir Lands to the east of Low Weir, assembled a 6-person team to drive a huge puppet depicting a mythical cricket-creature of a long-eared type. The long tawny pale green face of the hugely over-sized bug, with its remarkably piercing orange-yellow eyes and seemingly alert ear-tufts, gave a good impression of seeing-all and hearing-all while being utterly other-worldly.  
The great green cricket turned its gaze upon each of the dancers in turn as the puppet-team made it duck and weave and occasionally shake its herringboned patterned armor.  When it stopped moving, so did all the dancers.  They’d unfold its formidable wingspan while the revelers chanted all together, ever so quietly, and so powerful for that quietness, soft “chirp-chirp” calls, after which the wings would fold back in and the whirling dance resumed.
At the finish of the ritual of the blessing of the trees, the Cricket Dancers retreated to just inside the tree-line, where the giant facsimile stood perfectly still, almost hidden, throughout the rest of the festivities. 

Travelers from throughout the Weir Lands, Settany, Eelan and Oknott began arriving at the fair-grounds south of Eelan Toon that night. They continued to pour in all night and into the next day.  The air filled with rippling sounds of songs and conversations exchanged. The aroma of tasty morsels and hot spicy s’lah prepared on small cooking fires wafted all over the festival grounds.  

The Bees and the Sharpies arrived in their meandering way.  
The Fatunik Specials-in-disguise set up a booth purporting to sell faux-armor from Rutónik, to delight of a number of young ones in the gathering.  
The old man from the Agency and others on a variety of occulted missions, mingled throughout the crowds. 
Actors and bards always on the lookout for new materials. Plus a fair number of more serious scribes.  Many watched, listened, learned and in some cases recorded the goings-on.

Many of the arrivals were napping, having traveled a long distance and not wanting to sleep through the events of the night to come.
Azron Gurk was too tall, too old, too well-equipped and too obviously, outlandishly from “far away” to simply melt into the crowd. The Bees continued to circulate around him in an individual fashion, still without openly revealing themselves.  He kept a keen eye on them in return. 
He also spotted several Jaxen working with Innkeepers and Brewers collectives who’d set up stalls to serve the festival-goers.  In itself, the appearance of a few clones working with their employers at such a gathering  was not the least bit out of the ordinary.  The fact that at least one of them appeared to be, according to his instrumentation, of a new model not previously entered into the Agency’s data base, however, merited extra attention and observation.
So far he’d not detected any other noteworthy enhanced mechinics or implants. Just the usual assortment of concealed weapons and light armor typical of travelers through the western lands.

As the gathering began to settle in, not too long before Full Moons Rise, troupes from hither and yon put on smaller performances prior to the main events.  After delivering several cart-loads of supplies to their customers, a group identifying itself as the “Festival-Going Comrades of the Old Mill Cooperative on the Upper Pavan” unfurled a fancy bilingual banner. In elegant calligraphy it declared in both Eibar and Sogomsh an upcoming show called, simply, “Dance School”.  
A cantor stood next to the banner, intoning the announcement in the two major languages of the Saskan Lands, and alternating those with the same announcement in a beautiful, lilting classical high-country Ahbar.  This caught the attention of Azron Gurk, who’d not heard the ancient forms of Ahbar intonations in many years. Intrigued, he made his way towards the Old Mill banner.
The Bee who’d been embedded with the “comrades”, having spotted Azron coming their way, turned to one of the local kids milling around their fire, pressed a nibble in their hand and whispered, “Go tell the others to inform Our Mother that the Old Man is here.”   
Azron noticed the young one scurrying away but didn’t give it much account. At an event like this folks were constantly sending kids dashing around with messages, deliveries and invitations.  His attention focused when he saw the runner stop to whisper to one of the strange-acting hill people on whom he’d been keeping an electronic eye.  Tuning in to that conversation with a brief tap on his aural implants, he smiled and thought to himself, 
“So, maybe she’s here. This could get interesting.”

As the crowd coalesced around the small pavilion of the “Comrades of the Old Mill”, Azron easily picked out the spies from the Center. 
He gave a wee laugh, this time with a slight shake of the head. Bemused by their facile comprehension of Eelani capabilities, even after all that had passed between the Westerners, the Riders and the Heliops, he wondered how the Tagabants managed to keep so many folks afraid of them.  
He pondered the means by which these great communities of huums, who’d lived so closely together for so long, and who’d faced so many trials and tribulations in common, after all this time, still understood so little about each other.  
He lost his reverie when the cantor switched first to Oubarq, and then, startlingly, to full-fledged Growlsh.  

The hard consonants of the far southern dialect, followed by the gnarling, rolling bellow of True Growlsh felt like a smack to the back of the head for many in the crowd, who laughed and roared their approval.  The Fatunik spies were visibly shaken. The use of Oubarq was highly suspicious in their home towns. Speaking Growlsh utterly forbidden.  At a stern glance from the Watch Leader, they quickly recovered their composure and attempted to fit in by offering a few mild hurrahs. 
Switching to a mildly-inflected Ourbar in the popular flowing, soothing rhyme-and-rhythm style of the “Sacred and Secular Songs of the Eastern Riverside Kahilabequa”,  the cantor introduced the story of “Baleran and Rooma Go to Dance School”, a musical comedy wherein said young sints from a bucolic Dauni Vakasaqua’ village in the gentle southern Weir Lands learn to stomp and snort like angry horses, among other poses.   
The performance unfolded with a great deal of falderal concerning herds of “wasted” antelopes involved in a complicated plot having to do with a bumper crop of canteloupe and cosmic retribution. Nearly every line in the songs dripped with double or triple entendres, many of them utterly ridiculous, a few bordering on the obscene, a few crossing that line, many a bit stupid, and even more of them very funny, especially if you’d had a cup or two of s’lah.  

One of the Clockwise Sixth made their way to Azron’s side during the performance. Azron smiled at their approach as he tapped out the rhythm of the drama’s final chorus on his knee, incidentally activating a recording device and sending a ping to the monitoring station to let them know his current location, to upload his previous recordings, and to clear his cache.  
After the applause and snaps and hand-waving and shouts of encouragement were done, he turned to the Bee and said in what he hoped was a friendly way, “Nice, eh? But I don’t really know what to say. So stupid. And yet so fun!”
The Bee was about to respond when a junior scribe, who’d evidently dipped well into an entire bucket of s’lah, tripped over a rock and stumbled between them. The young one apologized profusely babbling away in a learned Krbshside Eibar with the tell-tale school-boy inflections of a freshly-minted Terpinol Academy graduate.  
Said he’d been trying to make his way through the crowd to observe the “Dance School” up close, but unfortunately had had little sleep the night before, and possibly too much s’lah during the day, and so on and so forth, all in a much too forward way.  
Azron was not amused. Drunk young scribes were one of his pet peeves.  
And he certainly didn’t need anyone from the East Coast asking too many questions about his cover story.
Taking a deep breath, and recollecting his mission, he turned back to the Bee, rolled his eyes, and said, “You’d think the Masters of Terpinol would teach these little twerps some manners, eh?” 

The operative from the Circle of Fives stared at Azron, seemingly unamused.  Then leaned in very close and began to whisper rapidly and urgently in his ear.  Halfway through the earful, Gundron noticed the lack of a red dot in his eyepiece and realized that his recording device had been switched off after that young scribe had “accidentally” bumped into him. 
Annoyed and little bit nervous at not having detected someone who knew his gear that well, he glanced about trying to spot the young scribe. But they’d seemed to’ve melted away into the crowd.  Too late now, he thought, and re-focused on listening carefully to the odd message being muttered into his ear.
“A new one has been brought in as a member of the revolutionary community supporting the comrades of the Old Mill on the Upper Pavan. Tell them. The new one is multiple. One is Two. Emerging from the Void, they will be the natural leader of the Workers Council of Greater Eelan.  The Materially Masterful Mother held a partnering ceremony, but the grooms did not appear since they were occupied with urgent affairs in Mabhakol.  Number One has smoked non-sint sea-catch with the Fisherfolk and she has drunk air-s’lah with the Royal Wind.  Everything is in place. The next offensive will be decisive.  The groom’s sisters stood in for them at the partnering feast. All is ready.”

As he began to figure out the import of this message, without turning his head, and trying very hard to not just let go with his dislike for the whole Saskantinonian tendency towards obfuscation and bizarre metaphors, Azron softly and simply asked if that was all.
“The comrades of the Old Mill are packing their bags now,” was the only reply.

Azron saw that the Comrades who’d put on the “Dance School” were indeed packing up their equipment. Evidently that last bit was just an observation, not part of a cryptic missive he’d need to decode.
Having caught at least some of the cryptic allusions, and trying to think of way to ask what they knew of his old friend Mikel Moballeq’s current whereabouts, or whether the infamous Monmar Massachawa would actually be making an appearance here at the Dance, he turned to look the Bee in the eye, ready to say, using appropriately cryptic analogies, “Say friend, where do the Fisherfolk smoke their catch now? And will Mother be joining the Dance?”

To his annoyance, the messenger had also vanished. 
“Dammit all to Betelgeuse”, he thought, both worried about what he’d learned, annoyed that this would probably mean an extension of his mission, and concerned that somebody might’ve heard what he said, Azron muttered, “Stick this damn sing-song serenade on a gravity shell.  Why can’t these Saskanese just speak plainly?”

Historical Summary

Physical Description

Inhaaybeted by huum even before the great migration, the province is lightly inhabited and has the most unique collection of trees in the Saskan Lands, including many fruit trees. The Toon of Juuj at its center was for many centuries the capital of Fatunik jurisprudence and religiosity, until the Great Argument led to the founding of Beshquohuk.  

The Ancient Elders of Juuj are still held in high regard by most Fatunik believers, even if Juuj no longer plays the central role in Fatunik affairs. 

The province is riddled with ancient temples and monuments, hidden ponds, secret groves, and mysterious caves, cenotes, underground caverns and tunnels.

Role in Story

The most loosely-organized of the Riders syndicates, the HHLC operates mainly in the northern provinces, from Oknott to Salotriza.  They make forays into Wesshewen and Ilysuhan as well, with occasional incursions into the southernmost Krunkinotto as well.

While focused mainly on gathering lumber, harvesting naturally-occuring fruits and roots, and hunting wild beasts, the HHLC also plays a role as a kind of communications network for the Rider Arms and the Fatunik Guardians, keeping on eye on the volatile northern border regions.

Type • Main Locations

Role in Story
Much of the culture of the Saskan Lands is embedded in song cycles particular to the regions. Bards are the cultural ambassadors, preserving tradition and knowledge, passing it along, and providing entertainment and a certain amount of indoctrination and philosophy for the masses. 

Actors tend to be more edgy and less well-received by authority. While there are some plays that have a long pedigree, actors troupes often present satirical and bawdy topical material.

Relationship to Other Organizations


Description

Loose federation of acting and performing troupes. Each has its own name, manages its own contracts. They share information and sometimes bargain together for a fair deal from a given Inn or locale. 

For large festivals, they coordinate shows.

Card Number: 32
+ / -  Main conflicts in this scene.

Resistance leaders in the Outerlands who helped Birakay make good his escape discover they have been betrayed.

Showan defends the camp when it is attacked by the Dorq Tagabant, looking for Birakay. He is killed.

Giltraq ends up unintentionally betraying the location of on Outerlander resistance camp to the Tagabant. This results in the death of Showan Nywing, who was visiting the camp trying to convince the Kahila and others to take a peaceful path to resistance. His death sparks the Byenung to increase their opposition to the Center and move towards armed resistance. And it sparks Ramona to urge the Traveling Sisters of the Dauni Vakasaqua to also take a more active role in supporting the resistance. 

Kirill escapes the trap, as do Birakay and Stan, who weren't there to begin with.

Giltraq is devastated when he finds out the consequences of his loose lips, contemplates suicide. Then he contemplates an anarchist action. Then he goes for a walk with B'arqo.

&gt; &lt;  Main events, resolutions, actions in this scene.

The Authority ups the ante, calling for a Holy Fire to quell rebellion. 

Massacres, pograms and other violence shock the Lands.

Thousands of ordinary Volunteers who moving towards the Northeast to stop the Ilyushan invasion are bewildered and demoralized by the orders, especially when encountering the massive resistance songs of the Byenung, the Afflicted and others. 

Tell the whole story of Giltraq (see his bio) in this section, unless it makes sense to foreshadow some of it elsewhere. 

Finish --&gt; B'arqo befriends Giltraq, shows him how snakes shed their skin, how Seffs (octopuses) regrow their limbs, and explains how a caterpillar will turn into a butterfly. Sends him off to the Nye Lands with a recommendation to Commander Gallex. 

 Timeline

Following on from Card 30, as the Outerland forces mobilize.     
Beauty

Being a witness to injustice triggers transformation. The impulse to martyrdom and sacrifice can be a strong one. Being able to turn it towards transformation of institutions is a kind of grace.
Humor

On his walk in the wood with B'arqo, Giltraq steps in some poo. 
Truth

Courage is also facing up to mistakes and taking action to correct them, to make amends, to transform ourselves.

Impact

Make the reader lust for revenge.

Description
THE HELIOCASTRONIC AUTHORITY

Usually referred to simply as the Authority, the Heliocastron is the leading body of the Fatunik Union (what I have formerly referred to as the Bishopric -- see separate note on the Fatunik Union). It is the Central Committee (if it is a committee) of the Union.  Its membership is secret. Some believe the Heliocastron is a single person. Others say it is a Triumvirate or a Committee.  It is entirely unclear to most folks how it is constituted. 

The great town of Beshquohuk, located at center of the Ring, where one finds an impressive Temple of the Sun, is where the Central Offices of the Heliocastron are located.  

Most of the major towns on and within the Ring, including the lands and villages near the towns, whether farmed by free-holders or vassals, is governed by a representative of the Heliocastron.  The local representatives of the Heliocastron are referred to as the Heliocastronic Officers and their residence as “The Office”. 

Titles  and honorifics for Heliocastronic Officers change from place to place, often in recognition of special arrangements that have been made locally.  Such titles include:  Heliocastrophical Governor, High Priest of the Sun, Toon Father, Fatunik Representative, Master of the Watch, Sun-Lord and so forth. 

The Fatunik influence is strong in towns to the north of the Ring, but less-so in ones closer to Borded and nearly non-existent in Eelan and other northwestern areas.  

Their presence is tolerated, for the most part, in the southern towns, but they are not given  authority over local laws, customs, etc. for the urban area. There they act more as a religious authority for their community of believers.

            <Title>Songs and Themes</Title>
            <Text>
MUSIC

Pondering a variety of ways to bring interesting musical themes into both the story telling and the game design.

- Develop a musical theme for each…
		+ Major character
 		+ Major organization or alliance
		+ Major town or region
	  + Possibly explore use of some automation/ML kind of stuff in doing this.

- Put some actual music and poetry behind the already strong motifs regarding song cycles, song catchers, bards and so on.  Try to avoid doggerel, lame verse, banal rhyming. 

- Regarding the trial of SPQ and the underlying epic political/cultural conflicts amongst the beks, consider using guitar and musical terminology to characterize at least some of it, creating my own “glass bead game” terms. For example…
	+ First Position — describes the orthodox Fatunik viewpoint. Musical themes use notes, chords, progressions easily obtained in the first four frets.
  + Second Position — describes the somewhat more open, reasonable Rider viewpoint. Musical themes use notes, chords, etc. from the first 8 frets
  + Third Position — describes the even more open view point of the Mobalbesq community, themes using 12 frets
  + Fourth Position — “outside”, “free bird”, “high flying” perspectives, using frets beyond the 12th. 




Music and song, especially song cycles, play a primary role in both entertaining and informing the population. 

For each region/culture, develop a “canon” of songs, in a particular style. 

Have some characters, like Birakay, whose main contribution is performing and coming up with newsong.

Others, like B'arqo, are songcatchers, who travel the Lands collecting the stories (songs) of the actors.

I’d like to drill into this pretty deeply, including things like assigning a standard Key and perhaps various musical traditions, to a region or town, that would play out in their music, in words used when describing that area, and maybe in software as tools for creative construction.

Short of composing music for an entire movie, all characters, settings and so on, one thing I can do to move in that direction is use the vast array of sound banks available from Analog Lab (the Arturia software) to create soundscapes with various qualities. It is fun browsing thru these sound banks and trying to associate sounds, sound effects with different places, actors, groups can even help in developing a feeling for, some nuances about characterizations.

The banks in Analog Lab are thematic collections of short musical themes, tones, algorithms that can be played on the midi keyboard. Sometimes they are very much just like sound effects, other times they create a specific mood. In addition to the 3 “banks” I’ve browsed around in, also definitely check out the:
* Sequences
* Drums —&gt; Drum Kit

And

* Sound Effects —&gt; esp. Machines, Robots

Available in Analog Lab.

It would of course be cool to have melodies, keys, melodic and harmonic patterns associated with settings and actors. But just having a simple phrase augmented by these banks would be a great initial step. Consider developing just a few melodic themes (perhaps when practicing scale patterns on the guitar), then mixing them up by using the banks and other effects.

The 3 “banks” I explored are all available directly from the basic Analog Lab app and are called…
1) Pigments 2.0  	 (P2)
2) Analog Factory     (AF) &lt;-- focus mainly on this one
3) Factory		 (Fac)

There’s about 2 dozen different synth simulators too. Each has dozens of modes. And everything is adjustable in various interesting ways.

Of the other synth libraries, the ones I found most interesting for now were Augemented Strings and Buchla.

Role in Story

A powerful and ancient Agent, she releases the gift of birds and insects -- and the great sea-creature Cereb -- onto Gavor at the end of the story. 
Goal


Physical Description / Appearance

Very much the Tibetan diety Arya Tara, She Who Ferries Across the Stars. Also called Jetsun Dölma. In Japanese: Tara Bosatsu.  

Naked. Powerful. Green. Multi-armed, offering gifts and knowledge. The mother of liberation. Protector against the dangers of the material worlds: flood, wild animals, acts of violence, the savior of travelers.
Personality


Occupation / Education / Training
One of the Agency "directors", like Vice Regent Bud Starga, who just appear from time to time and are so much more highly developed than most agents, they usually just do their own thing and then return to whatever realm they came from.

(In the game version of Saskantinon, I imagine having a level that players can graduate to -- and fall from -- in a multiplicity of heavens and hells, acquiring ever-more powerful abilities, with corresponding karmic loads.  Characters like She Who Ferries Across the Stars [whose name I will change to avoid directly imposing a particular religious view into the storyline] and Vice Regent Bud Starga come from these realms. 

The existence of these other realms populated by multiple "deities" who themselves have not all achieved bodhisattva or buddha levels but are still working through karmic turns, is part of what makes the Agency a rather confusing, if well-intentioned, enterprise.

Habits / Mannerisms

            <Text>The Runes of Bye, similar in some ways to the Nye Lands, are divided into many segments based on tribe, clan, family. But the story is more diverse. There is not just one tribe. The Bye tribe was thought to be once, in ancient times, the lords of this entire region, and they left many runes instructing their descendants in good behavior. These can still be found throughout the region, but are difficult to decipher since they are written in an ancient language that is no longer in use.

Interpretation of the runes over many centuries led to the development of an extraordinarily legalistic and contentious society which manages to thrive, as much as any can in this world, by a never-ending process of dialectic and argument. 

Byenung Toon and Lake Bye, a huge artificial lake -- huge to the point where many think of it as an inland sea -- are far and away the greatest achievements of this region.  </Text>

Type of Location
The northern province of the Weir Lands. Remote and independent, with some lands extending beyond what most would consider the extent of the Saskan Lands.  It is the realm of the Empafarasi, a clan who split off from the Bordeddi long ago and formed their own House based mostly on principles of hereditary lineage.

They are a warrior caste, much like the Riders of Borded in that sense, who protect the Saskan Lands from threats emerging from the west and the northwest. They are particularly tasked with finding and eliminating or countering incursions from the Krunkinotto, especially infiltrations and outright assaults by the created creatures who send the Jaxen, bugs and other such things into Saskantinon.

            <Text>Silence, Exile and Cunning.
Tales of Sorrow and Suffering.
The Trouble with Kam and Other Northern Tales.

Northward to Sorrow --&gt; another of Birakay's popular song cycles. This one preceded the ballads about Henqu and Iohane.

The cycle begins with a martial spirit, depicting the resolve and bravery of the northern Fatunik militia, the eternal defenders of the realm.

Kam's story is tragic. Through it, Birakay sets up and promotes a sympathetic understanding of the Authority.  This song was the first inkling of Birakay's break with orthodoxy as it begins to  subtly question the reach, the authority and even the veracity of the Fatunik beliefs and its order.

Tales are told regarding the Authority, their Tagabants and the barbarian threats from the north, the north-east and the north-west, both historically and in the present-day.  They focus on the Wesshewen and Ilyushan borders, with only an occasional lurid and occulted hint of what lurks in the Krunkinotto Mountains. 

The problem with the lack of bees and other pollinators is expressed in the exploration of the manually-intensive agricultural methods necessary to keep things growing.  Fear of flying is also a theme. The Fatunik take is that the back-breaking pollination work is a kind of deserved punishment for trying to fly.


Along with the Krunkinotto hints are dropped that some things are out there.  It is murky a fear of things that go bump in the night, wrapped up in mythic Fatunik legends about the Deep Poo, official Arguments regarding the Nature of Things, dangers that lurk beyond the mountains and beyond the clouds.


The Bolero feeling emerges again with a lyrical detour.  

After learning about Kam’s travails.   Giltraq enters into the picture as the song shifts its focus to Mixry. A good big brother to Kam’s troubled little brother, Giltraq's story drops hints regarding the southern culture, its secret societies, the underground "worlds" of the Kahilafolk and the untamed.  What makes the song sus for the authorities is its push towards optimism, its shift to an uplifting mood when touching on these topics. 

Through Giltraq's song, we learn more about 
		The wild gangs of the Wesshewen
		The bugs and the Jaxen, whom we’ve encountered briefly in Ríkila and Morilly, who emanate from the caverns of the Krunkinotto
		The situations in Beet, Mixry and Hádika

More detours are taken within the detour within the detour. The theme intensifies.

Duality-plus — two moons are seen as not alternatives to the main life-giving light source — the sun -- but as augementors.  A lietmotif emerges in contrast with variations on the trubek melodies from the beginning of the cycle, with their sadness, their grim determination, their heroism. It is the song of the Riders that emerges full-blown in the ballads of Iohane and Henqu.

One theme looks outward for courage, to a greater power, to connection with the source,
One looks inward for determination, to a warrior spirit, to connection with the essence,
Both determinedly anthropocentric, survival-centered, rejecting the inevitability of either Nature or Other (animal, machine, monster, the unknown out there) conquering or assimilating humankind.
Another detour spins off to the northeast towards Beet, the other to the far northwest towards Hádika. 

Both are reports that come back to Giltraq.  First regards an encounter with various influential Kahila and other underground/opposition figures at Beet. Second regards intense military preparations underway on the northeast frontier, where rumors fly about dark plumes of smoke, shadows, loud rumbles, creeping, leaping and wraith-like movements in the Ilyushan mountains,

The cycle ends uncertainly, without a clear resolving cadence.


Action.

Giltraq organizes a crew to go with a group of Riders, including Iohane and Henqu, to Ríkila to spread the word about impending invasion and to collect medical supplies, especially herbs and other medicines available only in the south, tying us back to the story of Iohane and Henqu and then to the notes in B'arqo’s narrative about the threat in the north-east.

            <Title>Long Canal</Title>
            <Text>Also called the Bye-Nye Waterway and the Arql Canal.

It is almost twice as long as the Great Bar Canal, but has fewer locks since the Arql Sea experiences very minor tidal changes, unlike the Bay of Bar, and the relative sea level gradient is slight as compared the Great Bar Canal.

While it is bordered by both the Nye Lands and the Arql territories, it is a Nye possession. The FTA and other Nye groups and clans keep a tight lock on traffic through the canal, which passes directly through the province main Toon (Wye), where the major set of locks is located.  

Occasional attempts by independent operators or pirates/bitamin, usually from Arq, to disrupt business on the Canal tend to be met with the kind of "grim" force (ninja-like romperi retribution) that characterizes the FTA and Nye "politics" more generally.

+ / -  Main conflicts in this scene.

Mikel Moballeq uses Showan's Argument in Beshquohuk and B'arqo's work at the Night Hall to encourage Outerland and southern constituencies to rally around the Mobalbesq forces heading towards Two Trees. [Check earlier scenes to see where we can weave this in with perhaps more detail.]  

He encounters a variety of counter-arguments.  Some agree that pushing back the Ilyushan is the main task. Others want to focus on resistance to the Fatunik pogrom. Still others, especially southerns, on protecting the new pollinators.

It is not clear to the easterners what is going on out West and in the North. But all are surprised at the sudden disappearance of many Jaxen. Rumors spread like wildfire.

&gt; &lt;  Main events, resolutions, actions in this scene.

Some of the storyline regarding Jax Remanj may move here from chapter 23.

There is widespread shock throughout the eastern and southern provinces at the arrest of Birakay. And equally widespread excitement concerning his dramatic jailbreak, which is sparking a new round of New Songs that build on the Iohane-Henqu themes. 

Various Byenung committees issue statements in support of the Arguments put forward by SPQ and Showan. Peaceful mass protests spread out from Byenung and the Night Hall begins collecting arms and supplies for the Mobal-Kahila army.

Some Kahila gang leaders are shaken by facing the fact that they failed to recruit someone who has now played a crucial role in taking on the Authority.  This leads to decision to ally with the Mobalbesq militias. The debates amongst the Kahila are not resolved in this card; they carry on into card 29.

Resistance forces from the Outerlands and the Southern provinces begin to assemble in the Mobalbesq lands and head northwards, joining up with some of the forces arriving from the Krbsh Sea, though many have been delayed by the fighting against the Forghans. Many Kahila-led forces organizing in the Kahilakol join together with the Mobalbesqi tribal militias after the Mobalbesq promise to protect them against the Heliops.

Some Agents formerly loyal to Bud Starga and some leading Heliops are won over by the Mobal and Byenung arguments.  Others are appalled at the unravelling of order and become even more entrenched in their fears.  A kind of center-left strengthens around the traditional Elders of Juuj.  A kind of far-right coalesces around Lohrn.

Finish --&gt; a sizable armed force begins to move north along the eastern Ring Road

 Timeline

Action --&gt; Roll back to various points, like where B'arqolad addressed the Night Hall. Follow the ripples of that as folks in Bye, Nye, Arq and the Settarune are affected by or hear about the events in Besh and elsewhere. [May need to review earlier chapters to make sure we have good point to roll back to.]. Tie together arrival, assembly of forces arriving from the sea (which itself needs a bit more explanation) with movement of forces north along the roads, thru the forest. Revisit some of our minor characters -- Kirill, Luvcando, Kam, Biff, Dex, etc.    
Beauty

Danger is the true domain of courage. Moderate courage and great ability is often thought to trump great courage and moderate ability. But in the context of great danger, this calculus is easily reversed.
Humor

The habit of war, that is, an Army's habituation to combat and to all the hardships of conflict, is the lubricant that make the difficult and trying frictions caused by war to become bearable. In this section, show not only the "barbarian" ecstasy in their raids but also the expertise and camaraderie of, especially, the battled-hardened Rider and Fatunik forces of the North. Combat in that zone is almost a dance. 
Truth

The lubricant can become brittle and shattered in the face of overwhelming enemy forces.  What is needed most of all on the eastern front in an injection of courage. The songs of the Byenung carry that truth.  
Impact

Hope and courage are inspiring. But on their own, not enough to hold back the tide of destruction.

            <Synopsis>Location Name</Synopsis>
            <Text>Kaghilamak

Type of Location
Kaghilamak is a permanent Fatunik military outpost located at the southeast corner of the province of Tabloonque, on the border with Kahilabequa and Juukol, in the section known as the Kahila Strip.

It was created at the conclusion of the Kahila Wars, when the Kahila Strip was occupied by Fatunik forces and ceded to the province of Juukol, thereby removing the land bridge between the two Kahila provinces.

Its establishment was controversial, but the reigniting of hostilities was averted when the Kahilabequans established their own permanent military base -- Iyaghold -- on the border with Tabloonque, as a balance to Kaghilamak.

Acts as something of a police force investigating, disrupting, forestalling illicit activities originating in the Outer Lands.

Type of Location
Unnaghobik is a village where a variant of the "Returner" belief system is prevalent, though necessarily in an occulted fashion to protect the villagers from Fatunik attention.
Role in Story
The cult in Unnaghobik are called Dexelites in reference to their founding cohort, who developed an ideology that syncretizes Fatunik views with the core restorationist concept that "everything was better before the Catastrophe, so we just have to go back to the old ways".

            <Text>APPENDIX

Words listed in bold italics approximate their pronunciation in Eibar and Sogomsh, respectively.  Words listed in bold are shown in the language used in this report.


Bar, Ber
The major languages of the Saskan region — Eibar, Eibarq, Sogomsh, Arqa and Arqq — are in the Bar family of languages.  The Bar language family also includes three minor languages:  Ahbar, Eibeerq, and Sleebar. Eibar, Eibarq and Sogomsh are mutually intelligible to a large degree. The others somewhat less so in comparison.  Eibar is considered to be the Ur bar language from which the others evolved.

beest
Almost always used as a suffix.  A -beest is any non-sentient animal, usually mammal, used as a means of conveyance.  Mechanical conveyances are referred to as a bexobeest.

Eibar, Eber
Eibar is the most pervasive language of the huum population, spoken by virtually all huum residents of Saskantinon, as well as most others sints north of the Settan River.

Eibar is the language of power in the Saskan region. It is the official language of the two major huum-centric political federations -- the Borded Federation, and the federated and associated provinces of the Fatunikan Dominion. It is the canonical language of the Noonday Scribes of Fatunika, who exert a strong ideological presence.  

In the the Kahila lands and in the Runes of Bye, provinces which are only loosely associated with the Fatunikan Dominion, Eibar is widely understood and used but Sogomsh is more pervasive in daily usage. The Magisters of Byenung are renowned for their expertise with spoken and written Eibar. 

The pronunciation of Eibar as it is spoken in the province of Eibar is considered to be the oldest and hence most "proper" spoken form. Eibar province, near the mouth of the Pavan River, was the earliest settlement of Bar-speaking huum in the region adhering closely to the Fatunikan dogma.  As the centuries passed, the Eibar language diversified as the huum population spread and immigrants arrived from Wesshewen, Ilyushan, Krbshanana, Aranzen and other lands even further away.  Along with multiple Bar languages, a wide variety of local Eibar accents, in some cases verging on dialects, developed as well. 

"Old Eibar", as the "proper" form is called, is particularly characteristic of three important organizations: the Noonday Scribes, the Byenung Magisters and the Council of the Eibarfolk.

All Eibar-speaking areas of Saskantinon sport regional accents.  In most cases they consist of minor variations in vowel sounds and a few idiomatic words. Those closest to being full-fledged dialects are spoken in the western provinces, especially in the remote hills and valleys of Eelan and the High Weir Lands, and in the remote northern plains of Oaknott, Norgyte and Sungyte.

Endor, Ander
Largest of 6 tidally locked moon-satellites of Gavor-Havorra.  Also refers to night-time hours generally, especially to nights bright with moonlight.  Used in naming a variety of moons-centered ideologies/theologies/belief systems.  

Fatune, Vaton
Sun/star at the center of the Gavoran solar system.  Also refers to daylight hours generally.  Root name of major huum political federation in Saskantinon, the Fatunikan Dominion. Used in name of the major sun-centered theology/ideology/belief-system.

fon, von
Fon, -fon, fonda- and similar prefixes and suffixes refer to any non-enhanced, non-sint animal, especially but not only mammals.  For example, an animal with 100% bear DNA might be referred to as a bearfon or a vondabear.

huum
Sentient beings with human phenotype (appearance) and who are presumed to have completely human, or almost completely human, genotype (genetic material) as well.

Gavor, Ghav
For those who understand the nature of the planet's astro-geography, Gavor/Ghav is the name of the planet, that is, of the entire world. Commonly used to indicate all land, seen or unseen, whether planetary astro-geography is understood or not.  In other words, all places that are not ocean. The world name is often rendered as Gavor-Havorra or Ghav-Avorr, indicating all the lands and seas. When used in an astro-cosmological sense, then just Gavor/Ghav or Gavoran/Ghavan is more typical. (Also see Havorra)

Havorra, Avorr
The world-ocean. All salt water bodies everywhere, whether the nature of the planet is fully understood or not. The world name is often rendered as Gavor-Havorra or Ghav-Avorr, meaning all the land and all the seas.  (Also see Gavor)

ixh, ikth
Ixh-, -ixh or Ikth-, -ikth refer to any type of non-sint creature that is neither mammal (fon) nor rip, and swims in the sea, lakes or rivers. 

Lurabar, Lorrber
Continent which contains the Saskan Lands and its neighboring regions.

rip, rep
Rep, Rip, Reep, -rip, -rep, -reep, etc. refer to non-sint reptiles and amphibians of all types, including snakes, lizards, turtles and tortoises. 

Sella, Zell
Second-largest of the 6 tidally locked moon-satellites of Gavor-Havorra. Used in naming a variety of moons-centered belief systems, particularly those combining river-centric concepts relating to the Settan.

Settan
The southern of two major river systems in Saskantinon. With its main source in the high mountains to the west of the Weir Lands, the Settan runs through the entire Saskan Lands from west to east, with many small tributaries feeding into it. The Settan fills the Great Bye Lake, then continues through its natural course to the Krbsh Sea. Saskan provinces south of the Settan are called the Settan Lands, where the river is the object of veneration for many river-centered ideologies/theologies/belief systems widespread in those provinces.

sint
Sentient beings with non-human phenotype, who obviously have some non-human DNA mixed into their genotype.

Sints vary a great deal in appearance. Some have very human-like features with only a few minor characteristics of their non-huum DNA apparent. Others are very distinctly non-human. Due to the modifications made and significant amounts of human DNA used to adapt brain size, larynx and, often, coding of extremities to develop fine motor skills, it is very unusual for sints to be indistinguishable or largely indistinguishable from  their non-sentient ancestors. (Also see beest, fon, rip, and ixh)

Untamed
The term "Untamed" was originally used pejoratively by huum opposed to viewing sints as equals. It was intended to cast sints as Other, wild, violent, dangerous and so on. Over the centuries, it was adopted by sints themselves as an ironic label and now carries little emotional weight; it just means "a sint organization".  (Also see: sint)

Within the Saskan Lands are a wide variety of sint organizations, often organized along species lines.  They vary in purpose.  Most practice self-defense, community mutual aid, dialogue and cooperation with huum or with other sint communities, promote training and education, and so on.  Others are more radical, some revolutionary, a few are violently anti-huum. These political groups follow a bewildering brew of ideologies.

+ / -  Main conflicts in this scene.

The Jax was supposed to penetrate the Kahila underground. Instead he penetrated Biff's defenses, which resulted in a synaptic break, a qualitative leap in his AI, resulting in taking on a name, reprogramming his own mission, and leading his pod through a new door. 

Dex has been trained to hunt down and destroy the Jaxen. His Empafarasi training is called into question when he discovers not only that he has a twin brother, but that his brother is entranced by a Jax.  

&gt; &lt;  Main events, resolutions, actions in this scene.

Jax makes an error, assuming Biff is an important player in the Kahila underground. A series of mishaps and mix-ups result in a sexual encounter between man and machine-man. 

Biff is arrested by the Empafarasi patrolling Ríkila. Dex is startled to see his doppleganger.  As the two young men struggle to recall their early days together, Jax Remanj engineers a jailbreak. More confusion as he assumes that Dex and Biff are members of the same pod, so he "rescues" both of them. 

Dex tells his back story to Biff, which Jax Remanj hears and reports back to his pod. Dex falls for the Jax's come-on's and engages in a three-way with Remanj in the middle of their homo-sandwich. For maximum comic effect, it is important to note that both Biff and Dex have rocking butts.

A convoluted love triangle ensues, echoing the SPQ-Showan-Birakay storyline. 

Finish --&gt;  Flash-forward to the opening act scene at the Full Moons. Biff and Dex, clearly several years older, are the proprietors. Remanj Jaxen is the "waiter" we met initially, but in this scene he is filling the two cool cats in on the gossip he's picked up from the guests.  

Timeline

Action --&gt; Big flashback. This chapter occurs in the immediate aftermath of the Event (the uprising) in Ríkila, which occurred ten turns prior to the events of our story. 
Beauty

The interval cadence. What happens between two moments. In-between the in-breath and the out-breath.
Humor

Full Moons. Catty cats. Cat burglars. Jax is a bit off. Keep 'em coming...
Truth

Placing yourself inside the mind of your opponent is a winning strategy.  
Impact

Love. Laugh. And I mean scream with laughter and groan with love-making.

SPQ's soliloquy -- but didn't we already do this earlier? Yes, but this is a wrap-up in calmer circumstances. More preaching, less meddling.

In this scene, Stan and Bir have been liberated and gone to Juuj.  Free at last, Stanley and Birakay shock the Elders by diving naked into the cold, clear waters of the Pool at Juuj. 

After their swim, SPQ addresses the Elders (who need better characterization) and others (what others?) gathered there, reviewing his Argument for a new social ecology along with the re-introduction of natural pollinators and for losing the fear of flying. 
&gt; &lt;  Main events, resolutions, actions in this scene.

An echo of the scene with Giltraq in Ingur, but with pretense and machiavellian intrigue gone, replaced by (literally) naked truth and honesty. In the Giltraq scene, make sure there is plenty of pomp and costuming and masking. In this scene, do exactly the opposite. 


Finish --&gt; The best and brightest of the Agents see that their work is done, mission accomplished. The station on the dark side of a moon is dismantled and shut down.


 Timeline

Also during the 6 months after Card 38.
Beauty

A tree hanging over the pond blooms for the first time in anyone's memory.
Humor

To the surprise of everyone (who?) the Elders (which ones?) join in on a musical jam with Bir, sharing some old songs (about what?) that have not been heard in a long time (how long?) and bringing out some musical instruments (such as?) they have kept hidden away. They open the Juuj Box.... :-) 
Truth

While other threats and problems are real, and must be addressed, ecocide is extinction.  

Impact

Something like when young white folks first saw and heard Elvis perform, before he got fat and sloppy, and it was so exciting they simply dropped their old ways and followed his style. Like when Keith Richards and Gram Parsons more or less fell in love with each other.

Coming ashore. Feeling like there may be a hero.

We learn about rogue Agents, dedicated Agents, incompetent inter-stellar bureaucrats and various conflicts At the Top. (This will require another voice. Here is where we break from reading Bu'ruq's (stolen?) journal and meet the agent who stole it.)

Finish --&gt; While the great auction is called to order (see chapter 7) MM takes Bu'ruq off to Juuj to work on an intervention. (See chapter 9b)
Timeline

Action --&gt; Following on from chapter 5
Beauty

The Kali/Green Tara fierceness and strength of Monmar Massachawa. We see that she is a devotee of the Green Lady Who Travels Across the Stars, and observe some delicate rituals. This is how we discover she is a "fallen agent" of sorts. OR is she?
Humor

The powerful people in the sky are just as incompetent as everybody else.
Truth

You think you're divine, but you're not. 

Impact

The goddess is a temptress who initiates trouble, who turns things upside down.

Description

Some huum went, literally, underground after the Catastrophe. They evolved to become small, with big eyes that work well in the darkness but are blinded by the light. Pretty much retrogressed, live kind of like underground rodents, eating nuts, roots, bugs, carcasses.

Other underground beings include sints who either moved underground or preferred to live underground as part of their natural DNA. This includes sints evolved from snakes, some spiders, rats, mice, voles, and so on.  

The Devosh (c.f.) live partly underground, in hobbit-like dwelling built into hills or into the roots of trees, often hidden away in plain sight. 

Sleeths and Terrapins also spend some time in underground dwellings, often near water sources.

At the Auction in Morilly, Birakay learns of SPQ's mission and his disappearance.
He begins to question his loyalty to the Center.

&gt; &lt;  Main events, resolutions, actions in this scene.

Riders, Heliops and some bitamin networks start to take action regarding the Ilyushan rumblings.
They ignore appeals to "Save the Lands" -- relating to SPQ's Arguments -- and consider the fate of Iohane and Henqu a minor event as compared to the impending monstrous invasion.


Timeline

A fortnight or so after SPQ, Henqu and Iohane have been apprehended.

Beauty

The diversity of lands emerges in the crowd of folks gathered for the auction.

Humor

A small play-in-the-play regarding the persecution (and saving) of a cat.

Truth

Perhaps the fate of the many outweighs the fate of a few, but what are the biggest threats to the many?

Impact

The "world" is bigger than we have learned so far. A massive gray economy is centered in the Outer Lands, beyond control of the Heliops and the Riders. There are at least four large regions which are part of the Two Rivers nation who don't follow the Fatunik creed at all.

19 • High Weir, Ríkila

Role in Story
Always nice to have some kind of twisty twins tale to play around with... in this case, it helps to tell the "tale of two cities" with respect to Ríkila -- that den of popular uprisings and conspiracies -- and High Weir -- those virtuous Empafarasi who fancy themselves the true elite of the Saskan Lands.  

Goal
Through their strange entanglement, reveal something of the east-west dialectic to this story, with a potential for synthesis when the two of them finally meet, work thru their personal anger and conflicts, to maybe find some kind of approach to not only settling the old mis-perceptions, but finding a way to merge the Old Rebellion and the New Way... 

Physical Description
Twin boybeks, but unknown to each other, having been separated at a young age. 

Personality
Dex is a member of a Empafarasi unit responsible mainly for patrolling the hills to insure villagers are safe from wild Fons (meaning non-sentient animals, wild animals) and on the lookout for incursions from the Krunkinotto.  He seeks glory and is known as kind of a shit-head. He is strong and quick, to his credit, but without a lot of fortitude.  Good in an encounter, but not on a long march.  Despite his tendency to tire out fairly quickly, he has a strong constitution and tends to heal quickly when hurt.

He's never been examined and claims to be 100% bek, but is sometimes (usually jokingly) called "Dex the Cat" etc. by his comrades.  His foresight and perception are sharp. He has slight powers of heightened hearing and seeing, with a mild ability to foresee possibilities clearly -- although he doesn't himself realize these are enhanced powers.  

His twin brother, called Biff, is similar in all ways, but has lived most of his life in Ríkila, falling in with a number of bitamin outfits there and making a living mostly as a very successful cat-burgler, and running a number of confidence schemes as well. 


Occupation


Habits/Mannerisms


Background
During the initial Empafarasi interventions in Ríkila, Dex was sent with an advanced team to scope things out. They arrived in an official capacity to parlay with the various factions and thus were quite visible to watching eyes of all types.  Biff picked up on their similar appearance and used this as a means to carry out various cons.  Following complaints from locals, Biff was eventually apprehended by Empafarasi agents and taken to High Weir under guard for judgement by the highland court.  That was how Dex and Biff are re-united.

            <Text>
In synch with the repercussions of the rebellion in Beshquohuk, and the ongoing Argument regarding SPQ’s work, ongoing steps towards liberation are taken by Kam. 
 
Jivákala and elsewhere — Kam

The Traveling Sisters -- a wee bit of Pussy Riot, a taste of the Indigo Girls, some Dolly Parton and the compositional skills and fervor of Sierra Hall. 

See if I can't tie his story into a bit more of the history of the event in Ríkila


Not sure I have a feeling for the point of his story other than background. It would be nice to have a view into things from perspective of a Fatunik citizen and in fact that will help to paint a better picture of what's going on. 

Need to tie his story into the events. Lots of new characters have been introduced in Act 2. Don't want to fatigue the reader trying to keep up. Need to care about each one of them and have them "make sense" or provide a pleasing kind of surprise. 

Perhaps...

* He was part of a Watch team that escorted SPQ to Juuj or Beshquohuk, or was part of the team that arrested him in Ríkila.
* Had some kind of encounter with Biff and Dex while in Ríkila -- they are the proprietors of the Full Moons. He could have been responsible for informing them, asking for their cooperation.  Perhaps this conversation includes some of the background on the uprising in Ríkila.
* Then has regrets.
* Basically a take on the Roman soldiers who crucified Christ and came to regret it.
* Have his story intersect, replay, remind various events in Act One:
	- Arrest of Stanley
	- Funny stuff going on in the Kahilabarbakol
	- More funny stuff going on in Juuj
	- Hauling Stan off to Beshquohuk
	- The execution of Henqu and Iohane during the Gleaming and the ensuing uprising
	- Assigned to Jivákala in preparation for combat with the Ilyushan - it will be a staging area and also is close enough to Borded to serve as a kind of warning to the Riders and other westerners not to fuck with the Fatunik Forces

Likewise, the Traveling Sisters not only have an interesting impact on Kam's story; let's have them intersect with, remind us about the main storyline regarding Birakay and the New Song, and let's have Ramona be one of their agents.

Indeterminate • Kaptar Village, on Tappan Island in the Remaris

Role in Story
Relate historical materials by reference to items that have been preserved in a honey-like substance. Since there are no bees in the Saskan Lands, this also foreshadows and opens up the question of where are the flying things, and intimates that they might not be too far away. Where did the honey come from?

Goal
Give a perspective into Returner cultures who really are tied to the past with an important mission -- preserving pollinator life-forms, seeds, and so on in the Time Jars.

Physical Description
Human appearance with the slightest hint of bee-like DNA in general busyness of character and in the very organized nature of the villagers and the way they use dance to communicate information. 

Personality


Occupation
Leader of the village. Keeper of the Time Jars. Items are preserved, some in a viscous substance, inside sealed, translucent containers. Turns out they are seeds, embryos, eggs of a variety of food supplies and pollinating creatures.

Habits/Mannerisms
Loquacious, talkative. Likes to gather information of all sorts. Workers and Finders are constantly reporting in. 

Background


Internal Conflicts
The Tapan Villagers don’t know clearly where the Jars came from, how they were made, or what the substance in them is. This has led to many internal debates about their nature.

There are some signs of bees about, but folks are not clear on what these are.

External Conflicts
The Agency keeps an eye on Tappan Village and other Returner enclaves, introducing misinformation campaigns from time to time if the villagers start to get too close to the truth about the Enclosure.  They try to prevent the expedition from reaching Kaptar Village via one of their spies (who?) on the ship. Then they try to prevent them from discovering the nature of the Jars.

Notes
Increased points for reaction, mental accuity. Favorite weapons are stingers — short, sharp sticks.

            <Title>Ring Road</Title>
            <Text>Ring Road

A road that circles through the central lands of Saskantinon.  The major and minor paths that track close to it. 

The Ring Road and the location of paths, towns, regions, villages, hills, caves, hide-outs, secrets, underground caverns and so forth in relationship to them provide a harmonic framework for the story-telling.

The Ring is a core metaphor for the world of Lurabar, and of Saskantinon in particular.  It  features in myth, legend and song.

The Ring provides a mechanism for the development of story arcs as characters explore and travel around and about it. 

Some of the key players trace a kind of passion play as they travel around the ring as members of the Rider Arms or other groups and organizations. 

I hope to make effective use of musical similes and metaphors loosely aligned to the metaphor of the Ring — key signatures, major and minor, the circle of fifths and so on — as way to develop stories and to enable and engender game play.

Related Themes

The circular, spiral nature of the game world is reflected in the physicality of the ring road.

The two rivers that circumscribe the ring roads provide a source of harmonic tones and melodies against the repeated instrumentation and chorus of the ring. If the ring is percussion and string instruments, then perhaps the rivers are woodwinds and flutes. 
Season

Let’s evoke classic views of the towns and rivers as seen from the roads. A visual “body of knowledge” maps the region in players’ minds.

Unique Features

Its history is buried in layers upon layers.

The looping circularity of the Ring Road has a metaphysical character. “It doesn’t go anywhere, but it covers everything.” 

Description

The Ring Road is largely paved. Although the materials are uneven they are have been worn to a smooth surface by the passage of countless generations of travelers. The Ring Road is one of the oldest artifacts of Saskan civilization, parts of it dating back more than 3,000 years. Going from points ‘A’ to ‘F’ on the Ring should evoke a certain kind of feeling. I won’t literally call this a scale, but that’s the kind of feelings I want to evoke, sometimes grand and happy, sometimes somber and sad. 

The minor roads and paths which criss-cross the Ring are sometimes paved, sometimes not. Smaller paths may be barely discernible.  These diversions may represent half-steps, sharps and flats, and provide the means for traveling along other “scales” that provide for different tones and nuances of feeling.

The Ring Road connects most of the main towns of the region. The lesser roads — the minor roads and paths — weave in and out from the great road, connecting the remaining towns and villages to the whole. 

The Ring itself is referred to in various ways … the Ring, the Passing, the Way, the Riders Realm, and more. 

Lands inside the major ring are referred to as Inner Sanskan, or the Skantaring, or by the names of the forests that make up most of its interior.   Those outside of it have a more diverse character, with each region most typically referred to by their own names and peculiarities. General terms for areas within the Lands of Saskantinon but outside of the Ring include Outer Saskan, Uiterring, the Frontier, and so on. (Ugh. Nah. I like other names better.)
Sights

A traveler on the Ring Road sees signs of varying degrees of obscurity in a large variety of languages.  And all sorts of folks. Beggars. Travellers. Riders. Pilgrims. Dorq Tagabant and Fatune Tagabant.  Bandits, Thieves, Bards (a word we will not use), Actors.   

The Ring Road attracts admirers of its antiquity, of its harmony, of its role in tying together the diverse constituencies of Saskantinon and binding them together against outside influence and threats.  
Sounds

Songs and tales of all kinds arise from the Ring.  Marching songs. Traveling songs and chants.  The rumble and movements of carts and oddly-shaped vehicles add an irregular syncopation to the more regular hoof-beats of those who ride mounts, drive herds or wear boots.  Every imaginable (name them) kind of musical instrument and voice.

 Less regular are reports of “sightings” of the legendary conveyances and bands said to have once travelled the ring, such as…

… the Shiny Chrome Train carrying the Irate Monarch — a long-gone but-not-forgotten ornery ruler of these realms who is said to have travelled in ring in sumptuous style. 

… the Flying Chariot of Airman Hector

… the Legions of the Reto Chair

… Charlie, who will come round again to restore to Metropolitan Charter

…and so forth and so on. 
Smells

Roadside inns, barkers and food merchants.  Smelly travelers.  Camp fires.  Gatherings and camps.

            <Text>Norgyte
Large northern province, bordering Wesshewen

Role in Story

Norgyte is the home of two major military encampments on the border with Wesshewen. Both are controlled/managed by Fatunik authority. 


Related Characters


Season


Unique Features


Description

Like Liganalupán, Norgyte is mostly a wide-open plain of grassy plains.  Wind, rain, even tornados are not uncommon, though its reputation as a having a harsh climate is overblown. 

Also like its neighboring province to the west, Norgyte has been the site of numerous armed conflicts and has a reputation as a bulwark against barbarism.  It is the martial center of the Fatunik Volunteers.  In their traditions and songs, it represents the Heliops’ ability to keep the Saskan Lands safe and whole. 

Sights
By area, Norgyte is one of the largest provinces in the Saskan Lands.  Very rural. Roads are not so good. 

Though officially a part of Salotriza, the large border town of Hádika is located on the border between Norgyte and Salotriza to the east.  The area around the western side of the Toon is far and way the most metropolitan part of the province.  Like both of the provinces it straddles, Hádika is very much a military-oriented and Fatunik town. 

The small town of Mixry is located in the southeastern corner of the province, just north of the Ring.  Kind of an odd place, really, it consists largely of a huge ancient tower where many of its residents live and work. 

Sounds


Smell
Norgyte is the center for meat-production in the Fatunik Saskan Lands. As such, there are some fairly gross locations (slaughter-houses, meat-packaging facilities, meat-drying farms, etc.).

            <Title>Otto Trucent</Title>
            <Text>Otto Trucent
32 • Borded

Role in Story
A key link to the Agency. A glue that helps to tie together several story lines. 

Goal
Introduces us to mysteries and largely keeps them that way. He reveals pieces about himself in the course of divulging them, so the only mystery we really get to know is Otto himself. 

Physical Description
Strongly male-identified. Likes to wear a uniform. Capes, badges, special hats. Carries himself with a regal aspect and has a grandiose sense of moment.
Although Otto speaks perfectly proper Eibar, and even though he is an avowed Catastrophian loyal to the Fatunik traditions, and even though he has an important role in the employment of the Rider complex of businesses, he has an other-worldly character that even he cannot explain.

Personality
Self-important in a beguiling way. Comfortable dealing with important and powerful people, but capable of communicating in a sympathetic manner with folks from any station. Somewhat stand-offish with mixed folks.

Occupation
Member of the High Council of the Free Carpenters Guild, which makes him a participant in some circles of Riders governance. 

Habits/Mannerisms
An enigma. Moves as easily through meetings with Fatunik Scribes in Beshquohuk as he does strolling through the mountains with the leading nobles of High Wei, sitting through negotiations with a chatty bunch of legal-eagles in Byenung, or attending meetings of the Riders High Council. A popular and successful guilder heading up an important group of craftspeople, Otto is a sought-after go-between.  
Tends to drink too much, which makes him sick, but he does it anyway.

Background
His family life is a mystery. He has no parents or siblings in the region. There is no registration of a partnering, though he has been spending a lot of time in High Weir visiting his Empafarasi friend. He flirts freely with many whom he encounters and is known to have fathered several broodkins. 

His own recollection is of growing up on a farm in Rutonijal as part of a natural family with mild Fatunik beliefs, of his gentle parents passing away of natural causes, of various siblings and farm hands who drifted away into other trades, of learning to ride a sloebeest at a young age and entertaining fantasies of becoming a Ring Rider, of the farm passing to new tenants once Otto moved to Borded to join the Carpenters. 

The truth is that he is the child of leading members of the 7th Observation Squad of the Rigelian Intra-Galactic Rehabilitation Sub-Agency, star-born, moon-raised,(temporarily) memory-wiped, and injected into huum society at age 12 (when he “chose to join the carpenters”) as part of an Agency program to get a closer grip on the problems they are dealing with.  He was scheduled to be recalled and debriefed but the paperwork on that has been mis-filed, so now, aside from some very high-ranking near-deities, neither the Agency nor Otto are aware of who he actually is.

Internal Conflicts
Strange recurring dreams that are difficult to make sense of, that sometimes seem to be about his youth, sometimes seem to be very specific directives.

External Conflicts
His High Weir love affair (with whom?) is about to blow up when he finds out his beloved has been promised to another.

            <Title>Summary</Title>
            <Text>The Wesshewen are mostly arid wind-swept plains, a kind of “Mad Max” post-apocalyptic hellscape. But at least lots of grass grows there.

It is home to roving bands of barbarians, mainly huum, but also some with powers, some mixed, and some wildly adapted animal species. 

From the perspective the Saskan Lands, the Wesshewen is —&gt; 

1) The source of annoying barbarian raids — worse in the past than in modern times, but still an on-going concern.
2) The source of meat. Hunting parties often travel into Wesshewen to bring home a variety of edible kills.
3) A potential area of expansion. Both Mabalbeq in the Borded Lands, and Norgyte in the Fatunika proper, as well as Salotriza to some extent, were occupied by Saskan forces over the centuries and “cleansed” of barbarian influences.  These regions bordering Wesshewen still have a very militaristic/warrior culture and also home to the main prison encampments in the Saskan Lands.

The “northern Enclosure” is said to keep even-worse barbarians at bay somewhere to the north, though it is hard to say since the further north hunting parties travel, the less likely they are to return.

            <Title>Outer Lands</Title>
            <Text>Arq, Mobalbesq and the Nye Lands are the core provinces of the Outer Lands.  They are de facto if not entirely de jure independent both politically and culturally from the other power and cultural centers of Saskantinon. While they officially recognize the suzerainty of the Authority, they have opted out of everything that would oblige them to forego their freedom of thought or ability to take independent action. 

This almost-independent status but even more so their geographical similarities -- they all have large shore-lines on the Krbsh Sea and share many geographical features -- is why they are known as The Outer Lands.

Used more broadly, this term also encompasses one of the Kahila Land of Kahilakol, the two east-coastal Fatunik provinces of Pavanarune and Eibar, as well as the Runes of Bye. 

While Kahilakol does not have a shoreline, its dense forest both connects and separates all of the key players in eastern Saskantinon.  It is an interzone that one often must travel through on one's way to or from the Outer Lands. It shares close linguistic traits with them and is completely bereft of any Helipotic loyalties.  And so it is usually considered one of the Outer Lands.

People will sometimes use the somewhat comical term the 'Inner Outer Lands' if they want to specifically refer to the 3 core Outer provinces which border the sea, and will say the 'Other Outer Lands' to refer to remaining four.

Pavanarune is located at the mouth of the Pavan and along the coast of the Krbsh Sea, also called at that point Pavan Bay. It is the location of the main Fatunik oceanic port in the Pavanrune Toon. Just north of Pavanarune, on the other bank of the mouth of the Pavan, is the province of Eibar and its ancient central Toon of Ingar.  Eibar includes a strip of land between the mouth of the Pavan, which is very wide at this point, and the Ilyushan River. Ingar is the first major Toon on the Pavan, just where the mouth of the Pavan begin to widen. It is bordered on the east side by the Rocking River.  

The Runes of Bye, while not touching the coast directly, are the location of so much of the trade passing to and from the core Outer Lands, and the center of so much of the politics of the region (see The Night Hall) that it is also considered to be one of the Other Outer Lands. In fact it is not only the most prominent 'Other Outer', but in many ways the most influential of all the Outer Lands.

Finally, fabled Krbshnana and the Remari Islands, while not considered part of Saskantinon, are sometimes included when speaking of the Outer Lands. Naturally, they are specified as the 'Outer Outer Lands' or the 'Far Outer Lands'.

            <Title>Terafina</Title>
            <Text>Terafina
Very Old • Near the rivers

Role in Story
Works with botos to develop livelihoods along and in the rivers. Terafina is non-confrontational and, unlike Ma Zada, has no great mission. She lives in her community, works with a small local group of allies, and simply endures. 

Was one of Ramona's key correspondents when she gathered the Folk Tales and Songs of the Terrapinas.

Goal
To provide refuge from turmoil, troubles and chaos. Assists folks in finding ways to endure.

Physical Description
Like all the Terrapinas, she is about 20% turtle DNA. Green skin and purple shell-like appendages in places. Very old, looks something like the portraits of Harriet Tubman wrapped in a blanket when she was ancient but still fierce.

Personality
Wise old woman who knows things. Is a leader of the Terrapina Clan, a confederation in which only female elders can vote on important matters. 

Occupation
Terrapinas are considered to be excellent servants by certain higher-class Heliops. Tarafina's collective resists being made into servants. They have an underground network devoted to bringing terrapins home who have been pressed or pressured into service.

Is variously referred to as "Queen Terafina", "Terafina, the Liberator", "Mother Terafina" and so on. She never uses any of those terms herself.

Habits/Mannerisms
Quiet, hard-working. Lots of strength and endurance. Slow-moving. Technically very adept, but in an unassuming way. 

Background


Internal Conflicts
Has lost many children, grandchildren, etc. to poachers, bandits and enslavers. Carries a great burden of memory and a smoldering resentment. 

External Conflicts
Working on a plan for liberation of all captured Terrapinas. But wants to resist use of violence, which puts her at odds with The Untamed, some Kahila rebels and other revolutionaries.  Natural ally of Botos and Byerunics, though more interested in practical solutions than the Byerunics.

            <Title>Act II - Summary 01</Title>
            <Text>This was an early draft of the outline for Act II.

=========================

Act Two is a Man in a Hole trajectory, with a Cinderella start. There is a rise, another rise, then some falling and rising, followed by a rise, then more falling and rising, a long rise, and finally a literal rise.

Alternate longer chapters with series of shorter ones.

In Act Two, a good amount of action takes place in the southern and western ladns. Weave in more of SPQ's backstory. Show the hard work done by the pollinators. Provide a foundation for how winged creatures will be brought back to the Lands.


==========================

1. Oh What a Relief It Is  OR  The Rising in Beshquohuk
(Beshquohuk, ..) 

This act starts with another view of the failed rescue attempt of the fallen riders from the terrors of the Gleaming. With help from a cast of characters who are not entirely working in tandem. 

The rescue attempt evokes memories of the rising in Ríkila, which we start to learn about in more detail. The near-following sections introduce characters involved, at least peripherally, to the rescue.


2. Kissing Cousins

Introduce the tale of Dex and Biff, taking us deeper into the east/west theme and exploring more about the Jaxen world. The rise here is, well, umm, you know.

(Or not. Maybe leave introducing additional Jaxen characters to another story. Reamanj Jaxen may be enough for this tale.)


3. The Glorious Sky

Introduce Mikel Moballeq, foreshadowing the long rise later near the conclusion of this act.


4. Sniffing Out the Problem 

B'arqo and Waleran get help from a shady crew, including Barq Rob-Eye. They pursue technology and alliances that will help to undermine the influence of the Heliops without weakening the huum so much that they will be open to attack from outside of the Enclosure.

Waleran takes on as part of his mission to spread the lyrics/song of Birakay’s new song.

Introduce Malavorra in more depth. Picking up from the movement of Act One,  continue a journey around the Ring.

Just when it all starts to make sense, and we think we’re on a standard D&amp;D sort of sci-fi adventure, we meet Petra Bearbek, who is  moving on a completely different trajectory.  Similar to the introduction of Remanj Jaxen, disrupt reader conceptions that this is a familiar story.

Provide a vignette on Snek as well.


5. Mother Knows Best

In synch with the repercussions of the rebellion in Beshquohuk, ongoing steps towards liberation are taken by Allane, Kam and Kaharan. (which may be 3 separate chapters.)

Heliohan and Barbol — Kaharan and Allane
Jivákala — Kam
Bordakol and Low Weir — Allane and Kaharan
	 
Show individual, personalized risings related to the rebellion in Beshquohuk. The inter-related stories arising from the rising in Besh should each tie in with the history of the rising in Ríkila. 

Fast-forward — news of the rising has had time to percolate around the Ring. We see how it affects these 3 characters and others. It might make sense to push this section further down in Act Two, so there’s time to explain the events in Besh a bit more. 



6. A Hunger for Madness

As the story-telling rolls from east to west, heroes and anti-heroes encounter difficulties and losses. Each explores the dark deep pool in their own way.

Explore the death drive in detail. Pursue impossible goals. Act as if, against all sensibility. it all makes sense.

The Empafarasi float into the frame as Petra Bearbek explores the underground caverns of the western lands. She sees that new solutions, new technologies are emerging from this area.

We find a border to the Enclosure for the first time.


7. Rolling Along the River

As Zadane, Malavorra, Petra Bearbek, Allane and Kaharan travel to the west, they encounter the  Terrapin Community and other "exotic" creatures of the southern lands.

The distinction between the Pavan and the Setta emerges in the songs sung in the South and the southern River-Goddess cults are encountered.


8. Sailing On the Seas

Otto Trucent, Gallex, and Luvcando the Shanowan head east, out into the Krbsh Sea. Rising and falling on the waves, they see another part of the world where sints have evolved, encountering the Delphine Queen and others.  Another encounter with a boundary around the Saskan Enclosure. 

The ship may be lost, but it’s not. 
The Sea may be full of monsters, but it’s not.

The Krbsh Sea is home to some important new friends — taking us all the way back to the first scene with the octopus barmen.  They live under protection of the Delphinic Empire but refuse to offer allegience to the Queen. 

There is fear of falling off the edge of the world. Or passing into a realm of horror and radiation.  But they don’t. 


9. Wing Island

New tech can be philosophical. An internal evolution is revealed. Not expanded consumption but expanded sharing.

The new tech is engineering magic.  SPQ's argument for the miracle of flight is grounded in reality.

A type of creature missing throughout the story so far appears -- those with wings.  The avionics have a messianic mythology focused on the Awakening of Cereb, a flying snake. (Maybe look at Zhuangzi instead of yet another dragon tale?  A giant whale and a vast fire-bird? Mystically conjoined...)


10. High Weir

The western trekkers continue up into the hill country, where they meet folks at High Weir who have some anti-grav abilities. 

Maybe levitation. Maybe they are holographs. Maybe they have mastered some type of flight or magnetism? Or something else?  It turns out there really is something to their windiness. 

[Resist the urge to introduce too much "magic", even in the form of "high tech". Maybe they are starting to investigate rocketry? Beginning to study aerodynamics?]

Continuing to explore the underground tunnels of the western lands, plans are revealed for gliders, kites, balloons, parachutes. All those kinds of things that have been carefully denigrated and misdirected by the Agents. 


11. Good Morning, Saskantinon

We literally rise out of hole. The first balloons rise. The first birds return to Saskantinon as the ship returns to harbor.  

Let’s get a bee, bat, moth, butterfly resuscitation theme going too.

It will revolve around a collaboration between Dauni Vakasaqua and some “Free Jax”, engineering bees (and maybe moths, butterflies, dragon flies, etc.) back into life, turning the “scary bugs” motif around in a surprise. Gives more depth to the Jaxen Civil War too. Good bugs / Bad bugs.

Card Number: 34
+ / -  Main conflicts in this scene.

Just like that, the bad Jaxen are driven back.

Maatsuuv returns from Aranzen (lay the basis for this earlier!) with a small army of mixed trans-huum and so-called Mages, with Sáamal Wititiri at her side, carrying a pod of glowing stones that prove capable of disrupting the Jaxen's internals.

The Empafarasi are miffed at being upstaged. (Who, in particular, is miffed? How does that play out?) 

The Dauni Vakasaqua don't quite know what to make of it. (Which ones? It is hard to believe that Malavorra could be flustered.) 

It is a random and unexpected event that shakes things up. (How is it known? Who reports it? In what way are things shaken?)

In a thousand years, Aranzen has never intervened in the affairs of Saskantinon. And of all the possibilities, it is the rabbits who have saved the Weir Lands. 

Most of the events take place at a hidden mountain village inhabited by the Untamed.

&gt; &lt;  Main events, resolutions, actions in this scene.

There are strange reflections (of what? How are they strange? Are they actual reflections?) in the Pool at Juuj. (Who is seeing them&gt;)

Recursions, repetitions, with a twist. Layers of themes coming together. 

Another surprise, OK. But need to give some kind of clues, foreshadowing. I don't think Aranzen or Sáamal Wititiri have even been mentioned up until now. 

Give some kind of hint regarding the "gemstones". Are they magical? What kind of technology is this? Powerful EMT devices? How do they affect the dissident Jaxen? 

What do the Untamed and the Aranzen want in exchange for this intervention? To whom do they address their requests/demands? In what forum?  What kind of reaction does it get from their potential allies? Amongst the Fatuniks and Outlanders? 

Lots of questions raised in this chapter! Needs more answers, more action.

This may be a good place to start dropping hints about other lands, peoples, sints outside of Saskantinon, particularly to the south and the far west. As we near the end of the epic, this could be a good time to start laying the groundwork for a much expanded view of this planet. Leave the shire/enclosure/empire... Head out into the world...

The gemstones are "star-crafted", gifted by Agents opposed to Bud Starga.

Finish --&gt;  The Mother of Voyages touches down in Juuj. She reveals the events in the Weir Lands to the Elders by creating reflections in the pool.

 Timeline

Continue from Card 33. The retreating Empfarasi and allies meet the Aranzen and Untamed forces who are heading north.     
Beauty

In the hidden mountain village of the Untamed (called ...), each cottage and each garden is the same. The same pattern repeated over and over. Yet each is situated differently in respect to the Sun and the Moons. Each has stairs that are slightly different, aligned to join the particular needs of its garden paths and its rooms according to its terrain.
Humor

There is an ancient mild animosity between the rabbit-and-hare sints and the terrapins, though barely discernable any more.  There are even love songs and fabled partnerships between the fast and the slow.  It really goes back to the olden days when they were emerging from non-sentience, building up their first settled communities in the huum style. Hares welcomed poor, starving, hungry, oppressed sints of various kinds to help them build, taking advantage of their labor and rewarding them with food and intelligence. Terrapin "immigrants" arrived at the Hare settlements already full of knowledge and wisdom, often with a small treasure of their own, looking to set up shop in the Hare Villages. And of course, despite their obvious skills, were all-too-often denigrated as "slow". 
Truth

As the universe expands, new galaxies are formed in order to maintain its density. As our view of Gavor expands, our understanding of its inhabitants must too. 

Impact

There is a timelessness in the construction of life and community, a spaciousness in the fractal unfolding of life. Just as the hare-sints learned from the huum, so the dissident Jaxen will learn from the Untamed.

            <Title>Fatunika</Title>
            <Text>Fatunika
Role in Story
The main political entity within the land of Saskantinon, the Fatunika — also referred to as the Watchtower of the Sun, the All-Seeing Eye, and so forth — is a theocratic bureaucracy that is both benign and malignant. It sponsors numerous social and economic and military organizations and institutions.  It advocates for and promotes an elevated role for non-mutated huum beings within the social order, and within that, promotes a “traditional” type of familial hierarchy within its faithful cohorts as well — though not of the type that we are familiar with. 

The hierarchy serves to enshrine the authority of a select group of elites, mainly men who follow a certain type of ascetic lifestyle. They guard their technological advantages carefully, play on huum fears of sentient-animals, and do so in the context of a doctrine focussed on Sun-worshipping metaphors.

The Fatunika is a bit of a Rorschach test.  It is a convenient kind of target for rebel story-lines, and plays a major role in that sense.  There's a sentimental-nostalgic aspect too, that draws on monotheistic themes familiar to many players and readers. Not a wholly unreconstructed Evil Empire a la Star Wars.  On a much smaller, almost pitiful scale. More like a national entity that has a troubled past, includes many dicey characters, but also feels like home to many.
Key Features
The Heliocastrophical power which governs the Fatunika is not only pro-huum, it has an overt bias against re-shaped or modified huum, as well as against fully-shaped (cloned, android) entities, and against both fully-sentient animals and  manifestations of animal-huum mixes. The most fundamentalist of the Heliops favor a 'return' to what they perceive as a 'pure' humanity.  

Fatunik science promotes a Sun-centered view of the universe that rejects ideas identifying the Sun as one star amongst many.  Some fundamentalist Heliops tend to be deeply opposed to vegetarianism, which they take to be a sign of pro-animalism, and to star-gazing or astronomy more generally, which they take as a sign of feeble-mindedness.  In the Heliocrastic cosmology, the stars are simply holes in the night canopy. Their light — obviously — comes from the Sun.  Less-sophisticated Heliops also tend to be superstitious about ‘evil forces’ which they understand to be emanating from the Full Moons.  

The Fatunika is a militarized theocracy that frowns upon heresy and apostasy, and is willing to take violent actions to defend its privileges and its ideology.  It lacks a preponderance of public support and does not have a monopoly on either force or technology. Nevertheless it provides both physical and economic security for many huum in its realm of influence, and successfully benefits from the propaganda of fear it regularly promotes.   A less-obvious role of the Fatunika is that its family social policy provides for a very controlled means of population growth. As we learn as the story unfolds, this is no accident. 

The general feeling promoted by the Heliops needs to be more like “Here Comes the Sun” than “Deutschland Uber Alles”, but it is a smile that masks a tension.  The “Gleaming” needs to come across in the way that witch-burning or heretic-burning must have seemed to pre-modern societies — that it is a protection against “evil” and even a (gory) kind of entertaining spectacle. 

Despite the intention and desires of Heliops, the Land of Two Rivers is quite diverse both genetically and ideologically. The power of the Heliocastron, as the high offices of the Fatunika are called, and its many watchers, specialists, agents, officers and other minions is far from total. The region seethes with intrigue, contrariness and revolutionary sentiments, as well as more open and less dire types of counter-veiling forces, from the agro-feminists of Low Weir  (Freedom) to the busy beavers of Byenung to the Riders of Borded, and more. 

Some of the towns and villages in the region have a large degree of autonomy from the Offices of the Heliocastron, though these types of situations are seldom without their troubles.

Card Number: 33
+ / -  Main conflicts in this scene.

All is lost all over again.

The Jaxen, along with a wild bunch of anarchists around Jesse K (name? -- And, this is the first time we've seen this character... Need to introduce JK earlier, probably with the Old Mill Cooperative), unleash a deadly assault on the High Weir Lands. The Empafarasi forces and allies retreat towards Low Weir. 

Jesse K, who is pretty much stark raving mad in most peoples' mind, has been manipulated by Bud Starga (weave him/her into the story earlier -- as the "Lorhn" character for Bud). They see the Jaxen as a necessary corrective to the troublesome forces gathered in the West, who, if allied with the Riders, could upset the balance of power in the Saskan Lands. 

(Who tells of these events? And why does Bud Starga care so much about maintaining the status quo? Is it simply a misguided notion of balance? Is this ultimately a conflict between Buddhists [or Confucianists] and Taoists? Maybe something a "Reform vs. Revolution" thing? A philosophical debate over where there can be a "less than nothing" from which "events" emerge?)

Historical Flashback:  In the post-migration period, as the fighting between the huum started to favor the western forces, the Heliops ignited the Great Wall of Fire is ignited to drive back the Eelani advance on the Borda Woods.  Borded allied with the Eelani. A scatterling of families retreated further to the West, up into the mountains and weir lands, where they built a great tower to keep watch for enemies from the east and north.

(Who relates the flashback?)
&gt; &lt;  Main events, resolutions, actions in this scene.

Allane and Kaharan have traveled to the west with the Eelani forces joining the Empafarasi (so describe that), who see them as martyrs unfairly accused by Tonedo and persecuted by the Lohrnites.  Just when they think they are safe, all hell breaks loose upon them as the bugs and machines emerge from seemingly everywhere.

Malavorra leads the retreat towards the southern weir lands, where they meet Maatsuuv and Sáamal Wititiri (see card 34), along with "mages" from Aranzen and a corps of warriors from the Dauni Vakasaqua led by Petra Bearbek (may need to tweak her story a bit more to show how she got there).

Bu'ruq and Qu'rub, who had continued westward with Monmar Massachawa (make sure that is described, you know, with good action and meaning! :-) ) after participating in the liberation of Stan and Birakay, are killed or severely injured in the fighting. Monmar goes to ground, rallies her network of agents centered around the Old Mill, who launch guerilla attacks on the Jaxen.

Deep underground, Waleran Tanaraka has found the dissent Jaxen headquarters (and... Yeah... Need to see where that happened and feel his quest). He sits with Remanj Jaxen, who reviews the history of fighting amongst the huum, the origins of the Empafarasi, and the development of the dialectic within the Jaxen hive mind that resulted in the self-generation of the free Jaxen. 

Finish --&gt; A green star (a comet, who is Green Star, She Who Ferries Across the Stars, The Mother of Voyages) appears in the night sky. This is noted by the Sleeths, the Terrapins, the Agents, the Jaxen and the Stargazers Observatory (in Terpinol?).


 Timeline

Picks up from Chapter 16 and related scenes. There is some uncertainty about the Empafarasi, Eelani, Rider alliance. Then just when it seems about to coalesce, the Riders are pulled away to fight the Wesshewen, leaving the East to suffer, and the Empafarasi, with Eelani support, have to deal with an assault from the Krunkinotto.     
Beauty

Grace arrives without rhyme or reason. It is literally a deus ex machina.  The divine feminine asserts itself in various ways.
Humor

Tell a story of how Qu'rub was left in the hospice triage for the dying, but was found by a song catcher who knew of his heroics, who paid a physik to treat him, and how he was nursed back to a state in which it is thought he will survive. The physik recommended he not be subjected to the cries and moans of the dying, lest it disturb his recovery, and prescribes a micro-dose be administered of a morphine-like substance in the evening. In the mayhem, the unqualified staff administer a fatal dose. The song catcher buries Qu'rub with a dozen white roses and one red one. 
Truth

Art is the return from fantasy to reality. While the artist has to be introverted, neurotic, obsessed and can appear to be anti-heroic, the nature of sentient beings is not corrupt and is heroic. 

Impact

Make the reader feel the tragedy of war.

Town

Role in Story
Located where the western Ring Road crosses the River Setta, Barbol is the only Toon in the vast agricultural province of Settarune. An important cultural and business center, it is one of the largest and most vibrant of the Ringtoons.

Countless southern mystical groups and temples have their centers there, along with the whole range of artisan and guild outposts needed to keep the vast manually-intensive agriculture of the Southern Lands in operation.  Although the Dauni Vakasaqua are headquartered not too far to the west, at Low Weir, Barbol is effectively the everyday capital of both Settarune and Barbarana.

On top of the business it does with all of the other regions of Saskantinon, Barbol is also a place where visitors from Aranzen are welcome and there is a thriving trade in knowledge, goods and services between the southerners and the varied mixed and powered denizens of the mysterious southwest.

            <Text>

The new tech is engineering magic -- the miracle of flight. Overcoming the fear of flying. Rising out of the deep pool of the far ocean, the crew lands on an island of new life.


Even more so than flight, the new tech is philosophical and ideological. An internal evolution is in process.  Not expanded consumption, but expanded sharing. The pollination of new ideas.



A type of creature mostly missing throughout the story so far appears -- those with wings.  Mainly bees. But birds too, and other kinds of bugs.  And... An enormous, ungodly thing.

Though most of the flyers are fons, there are some avionic sints. Ancient ones, who have a messianic mythology focused on the awakening of vast enigma, both sea and sky, water and wind, ice and fire.  

As in the Zhuangzi, a thing like a whale the size of town arises and transforms, becoming a firebird, a phoenix, flying high above the clouds. Here, the Agency meets it match, is superseded, is made redundant. The perception of beings grounded on the land, in the sea, or even in the trees and the sky, can barely conceive of it. They would need to forget their civilization, their knowledge of the way things are, to even begin to grasp it. 


An ancient itself, Snek had anticipated the rising of the enigma, but even Snek could not describe its nature. </Text>

Town

Role in Story

The only town in the vast agricultural province of Barbarana. Located on the south side of the Ring Road. A smaller route leads from the town south, across the border into Komikol, and further on for a short distance to the Bay of Bar.  This route and the strip of land to the east of that road, along the Bay of Bar, may become a flashpoint of conflict between Saskantinon and Komikol.

Along with being an inconvenience for sea-farers landing in that area intending to trade with Saskantinon, who have to deal with the confusing and byzantine Komikol regulators, it is also a staging ground for occasional raids into Barbarana, especially during hard years, by the wolf packs and others from the animal-sint-dominated Komikol.

For these reasons, the Toon of Kurosol, despite being located deep inside the Southern Lands, has something of the feeling of a Tagabant Toon, where local forces have invited both Rider Arms and Fatunik Volunteers, as well as various others, to help protect the southern flank of the Saskan Lands. On top of that, it is, aside from Terpinol, a rare locale for of diplomatic communications between the Saskans and the Komikolki.

Police/Military • Fatunik Toons and territories

Role in Story


Relationship to Other Organizations

THE TAGABANT

The Tagabant enforce the gaze of the Fatunika (see Authority).

In the towns of the Fatunika (that is, those areas “watched over” by the Authority) everyday power lies not in the hands of the Heliocastronic Offices per se but in those of the multiple agencies and institutions who enforce the Law of the Sun as promulgated by the Center.  The strong arms of the Fatunika are organized into five guilds: the Fatune Tagabant, the Dorq Tagabant, the Volunteers, the Agents of the Sun and Heliocastronic Specialists.  [Note: come up with better names using localized and more amusing lingo...]

The Fatune Tagabant enforce the sunlaw during sunlight hours. They are beat cops, the visible enforcers of order.  A large guild organized into a multitude of ranks and positions, the Fatune Tagabant is active in every major Toon except Borded.   Its members usually barrack in a walled compound of their own.  The Fatune Tagabant is huum-centric (beklek) and gender-neutral (byndir), reflecting Fatunik cultural norms, where performance of gender roles are highly formalized and restricted.  The uniforms of the Fatune Tagabant reflect their rank, assignment and location.  But even folks in position of authority or who are partnered do not express gender while on duty.

The Dorq Tagabant, as one might expect, works at night.  In the Fatunik theology, their duty is to combat the evil coldness that emanates from the two moons and to protect the Sacred Fire, that is, the sunlight, from the dire influence of the night.  It is a much, much, ummmm, shadier organization than the Fatune Tagabant.  Including undercovers, infiltrators, listeners and agents in its ranks, the Dorq Tagabant sometimes wear distinctive attire but often try to blend in to their surroundings, especially in towns and areas not under strict Heliop control.  Whilst they share a barracks and a common command structure with the Fatune Tagabant, members of the Dorq Tagabant are less obviously identifiable than their day-time comrades.  Along with being a very distinct organization within the Watch, they have a more marked tendency towards brutality than the Fatune Tagabant.  Like the Fatune Tagabant, the Dorq Tagabant is officially byndir-only and they tend to be more vociferous in their disdain for any kind of gender display than their daytime partners. 

The Volunteers, as their name implies, are the citizen-militia of the Fatunik community.  Called into service as needed, Volunteers carry out a wide variety of duties, including labor and repair chores along with enforcement duties.  In cases of emergency, they rise to what amounts to the national defense. They are in a very real sense are the citizen-soldiers of the Fatunik Army.  They are much closer to hearts of ordinary Heliopters than the other services are.  

Some Volunteers take their responsibilities more seriously than others, identifying with the bravado of the Fatune Tagabant or the stealthiness of the Dorq Tagabant, depending upon their instincts and personalities.  Volunteers posted to military camps are pretty much full-time soldiers. Attempting to rise to prominence in the Volunteers is a common path towards apprenticeship in the Watch.  Although still dominated by byndir culture, unlike the official Watches, the Volunteers do not expressly forbid gender expression, nor is it punished. In this they tend to follow more closely “civilian” norms in this area, where folks in positions of authority or who are coupled are freer to perform gender. 


The Agents of the Sun are tasked with being savvy about all activities throughout the Lands of Lurabar (and beyond) which can affect the prosperity and security of the Fatunika of Saskantinon.  They  organize the defense of the realm, including industry, supply and arms-manufacturing.  The Agents are investigators, detectives, diplomats, bureaucrats, guild-leaders, engineers, analysts, politicians, office-workers/scribes, and managers. They are the professional class of the bureaucracy, among the few who have something of a clear understanding regarding the borders of the Enclosure.


Something of a Praetorian Guard, the Meyajo Tagabant and the Candlemakers , provide specialized services for the Fatunika in general and for the Central Authority in particular.  Little known to the general public, they are the internal support system for the “Agents of the Sun” and for the Heliocastron itself, providing every type of “special” service needed to ensure the perpetual authority and security of the Center. 

They operate in the shadows, using a variety of covers. The Fatunik Candlemakers guild is run almost entirely by Specialists. They are the "KGB" of the Authority.


The Tagabant of the Ring Toons – those towns which sit on or very near to the Great Ring Road of Saskantinon – along with the other armed forces of the Fatunik Union and those of the Rider  Arms who patrol the Ring and the Rivers, with help too from the eastern seafarers and river rats, provide the main line of defense for the Fatunika against external enemies.  

With the major exception of Ríkila, where relations between the townspeople and the Tagabant are extremely tense, the Fatune Tagabant and the Volunteers are respected by and large for their role in defending the region from foreign incursions.  Folks tend to have fewer opinions about the Dorq Tagabant and the other agencies, whose role is both less obvious and more deadly.

Card 9a

This chapter focuses on Showan and Birakay. And through them, flashbacks to Quinn's background and childhood.


As our team travels the seaways and roads to Byenung and Wye, rumors swirl about events at the Authority, the Byenung intellectual-legal community is an uproar over the arrest of Quinn, Henqu and Iohane, and the Mobal Beshqi mobilize their own Argumentation team to defend the New Science. 

Showan debates fine points of the Law in preparation for presenting the Byeling Arguments to the Elders at the Deep Pool in Juuj.  

Birakay, through ongoing performances and interactions with fans thorughout the Outer Lands, foreshadows stories that will be wrapping up or presented as cliff-hangers in chapter 10 of Act One. 


These tales reveal aspects of the archetypal selves of Showan, Birakay and Stanley:
- The mask - how they present themselves to the world
- The shadow - their sexual and other instincts
- The anima - the feminine aspects of their character
- The self - cohesion of conscious and unconscious, complete, rounded "mandala" selfness
- Of the other other 12 standard archetypal images, they each tend towards...

Showan: sage, ruler, caregiver
Birakay: creator, jester, lover
Stanley Quinn: explorer, rebel, hero


Nobody and nothing flies in the Saskan Lands. Azron Gurk, a wizardly-character, intervened to prevent SPQ from thinking too much about flight, creating a mystery about who that character is --while literally bringing Icarus down to earth.  


As the tales wind down, Jax Remanj, the waiter from the first chapter, acts up, throwing a kind of zen wrench into the idea that we thought we understood everything.  So this chapter ends on a discordant  tritone. Not a recognizable song cycle.

            <Text>Borded
On the Ring, on the main Tributary of the Northern River

Borded is the largest and in many ways the most important town in Saskantinon.  It is the most powerful enclave within the region that is not under the control of the Heliocastron and it the central town for four northeastern districts, including the Riders Realms of Liganalupán, Oknott and Sallofol. With its strong walls, well-cared-for streets and buildings, many of which are made of enormous stones, its beautiful gardens and the large well-tended free-holder fields which surround it, the town of Borded, the Riders Toon, is a wonder and a delight to behold.  

The Riders Council provides for the preservation of order in Borded.  As the home base of a militarized guild which specializes in import-export trade and arms manufacturing, Borded is both well-provisioned and well-fortified.  


Sitting astride the Ring to the northeast, Borded is Saskantinon's great jewel along the River Bloobar, which flows by just to the south of the town.   In times of trouble, sentient folk from all the surrounding regions flock to the protection of its massive walls. Its two towering gates on the Ring Road make it impossible to proceed along the Ring without passing through Borded. A smallernorthern gate opens to the Mabal Trail, leading north to the border town of Beet.  

Dominating the Ring Road in this way forces many foreign travelers to go through Borded on their way to the Fatunik capital or to pretty much anywhere else in Saskantinon.


One might usefully think of the sub-areas , usually referred to as provinces [we’ll find more words…] of Saskantinon as something like counties or departments or districts.  None of them have official standing as far as the Fatunik Union is concerned, but these sub-regional designations are very commonly-used cultural, historical, demographic and geographical terms and many residents of the Saskan Lands refer to these sub-regions in a fundamental way.  The districts are sometimes grouped as either Inside or Outside, depending on whether they sit inside or outside of the Great Ring Road.  

Borded is the focal point for four of the Eibar-speaking northeastern regions, encompassing two “Outside” provinces – Liganalupán and Oknott – and one “Inside”: Sallofol.  The Riders Council also has a strong but considerable less direct influence on the region of Eelan, the south of Oknott.


In the steeply ascending mountains to the west of Borded, following the River Bloobar up into the “Forbidden Hills” of the Krunkinotto, is the heavily guarded Outer Province of Liganalupán, patrolled almost exclusively by the Riders. The Liganalupán is the only huum-inhabited region of Saskantinon that is, for all intents and purposes (though not officially) off-limits to Heliocastronic agencies.  It is the Rider hinterland.   


A High Priest of the Heliocastronic Office is assigned to the Toon of Borded.  He resides in a fine temple and receives respectful treatment as the leader of a popular religion and chair of an important guild alliance. But the Fatunik Union does not control Borded.  Here the Sun's Tagabants are not even permitted to build a barracks.  The prestige, wealth and military potency of the town resides entirely with the Riders Council, who exercise their (mostly) unquestioned authority through a democratic charade known as the Free Hostelries Cooperative Council. 

This Riders-led guild alliance includes the Vintners, Brewers and Bakers Guilds as well as the Free Innkeepers and a few other less well-established guilds.  It also has significant ties to mining interests and weapons manufacturing.

            <Title>Summary</Title>
            <Text>The Kahila Lands are inhabited by the Kahilafolk. Not exactly a tribe or clan, they are free folk who, at various times over the centuries, have rejected Fatunik Thinking entirely. Likewise they are not fond of the neo-feudal lordship, vassalage, protectorate models of governance promoted in the western lands. They refuse to recognize the authority of Beshquohuk or Borded.

Choosing warfare rather than retreat, the Kahila fought openly with the Heliops for centuries, culminating in the decades-long and bloody Kahila Wars that resulted in the establishment, with more or less official borders, of the two Kahila enclaves: the Kahilakol and the Kahilabequa.

The deep forests of the Kahilakol, called The Barbakal, have long been their deepest refuge. Difficult to penetrate and full of hidden enclaves, Fatunik Tagabants and Volunteers long ago gave up trying to control it, choosing instead a policy of accommodation with Mobalbesq  in order to surround and isolate the Kahila stronghold. That was only partly successful, as the Kahila fought for and won the corridor to Bye, giving them relatively safe passage through the Runes to the Kahilabequa. The eastern routes to the sea through Mobalbesq are, likewise, well-traveled by the Kahilafolk, generally without serious incidents.

The Kahilakol remains the more recalcitrant Kahila province, home to every type of rebel, including many romperi and bitamin groups. Supporting a very diverse population, and located quite close to the ancient Authority at Juuj, the persistence of the Kahilakol was one of the main reasons for the establishment of a new Authority at Beshquohuk during the Kahila Wars.

The Kahilabequa is a larger province than the Kahilakol, and was the setting for much of the violence perpetrated by Fatunik forces before and during the Kahila Wars. Forests were denuded. Villages burned. Massacres occurred. While the resistance never died, and memories are long, the current population of the Kahilabequa is less obstreperous in its opposition to Fatunik control than their cohorts in the Kahilakol. While life is not easy anywhere in the Saskan Lands, the culture of the Kahilabequa is similar to that of the southern provinces. Bordering the Setta, and located between the Settarun and the Runes of Bye, Kahilabequa attracts more entrepreneurs than it does rebel groups.  

The province lies just south of the well-fortified Fatunik central regions. The Kahilabequa border with Tabloonque is heavily guarded on both sides and remains fairly tense, with major Fatunik outposts along the way. A strip of land presently occupied by the Fatunika is still claimed by both sides. It would directly connect the two Kahila provinces and it passes very close to Beshquohuk. Some of the bloodiest battles of the Kahila Wars were fought in this area, with the Fatunik Volunteers ultimately seizing most of the corridor and establishing their new capital near it. 

Much of the political theater in Kahlibequa revolves around whether to support rebels in Kahilakol, or adopt something more like the legalistic approach to autonomy promoted by the Runists of Bye, or the cultural/identity distinctions often associated with the Mobal clans.  Like Kahilakol and Arq, there is little in the way of organized government in the Kahilabequa.  Though the Toon of Brokilly, a major trading center on the southern river, exerts a lot of influence in the region — and its biggest merchants guilds could be considered something like a leading council — the independent spirit of the Kahilafolk permeates the region, both in terms of open defiance of Fatunik and Bordeddi norms, and in the sense of a determinedly anti-authoritarian culture.

+ / -  Main conflicts in this scene.

Snek is discovered as a stowaway on the vessel and directs the crew towards Wing Island.

Luvcando and Grim Malek clash with Kirill over how they will divvy up expected spoils of the adventure.  They are all surprised when the booty they seek turns out to be some large, sealed jars.
&gt; &lt;  Main events, resolutions, actions in this scene.

[Also see notes in biographical stuff on the Hyppofarge, Tappan Island, etc. This section probably needs more development &amp; some good chaarcters.]

Picking up from chapter 12, the sea voyage is well underway. There have been encounters with the Delphine Queen and various strata of inhabitants in the Krbsh Sea. The role of the Seffs within the underwater realms parallels that of the Agency in the land and sea. Other sea-sints consider them aliens, difficult to fathom, ungovernable, throwbacks to a much older time and so on. 

We are well into the unknown, approaching the Remari Islands, far beyond where any Mobali ship has traveled before. Many of the crew have perished or gone mad. The Seffs are pretty much tugging the ship at this point, and have been joined by much larger Seffs, as well as by a whole variety of octopus, nautilus and other cephalopod fons.  The survivors are eating mostly fish supplied to them by the Seffs.  

Though they have been collecting rain water as they passed through numerous storms, now they have hit a dry spell and are close to running out of fresh water.

Some birds are spotted, amazing and confusing the crew, who tend to believe they are hallucinating. Indeed, some of them are. The Seffs are tricksters and fed hallucinogenic fish to some of the crew.  

Snek emerges from hiding. The Seffs recoil from him in astonishment. He speaks to them in a language that none of the humans can understand. They change course slightly, eventually bringing the ship into a natural harbor on what the crew start calling "Wing Island" due to the astounding presence of all sort of fowl and winged creatures, who set up quite a cacaphony when the ship puts down anchor.

  An enormous raven (? Or... ) visits the ship, accompanied by a kind of honor guard of very large hummingbirds. They converse with Snek, to whom they show a great deal of respect. Snek leads the crew onto land, through the dense forest, to a village inhabited by ancient snake and bird sints. 

The crew are instructed to take 8 very large sealed ceramic jars back with them to Saskantinon, and then the take one jar to each of the directions, then open them. The jars are humming.  When the crew return to the ship, all the barnacles have been cleaned off, repairs have been made to the sails, and the stores are full of fresh fruit, vegetables, dried meat, water and there are pots of a sticky substance none of them has seen before. Kirill tastes it and passes out from the delirium of tasting honey for the first time.

Finish --&gt; Not long after they set sail, there is a huge bizarre disturbance in the sea. It makes no sense, like nothing they've ever seen. There is no storm. The sea itself is roiling. A whale-like creature, but easily 50x larger than any whale they've ever seen, surfaces, blows, dives, repeatedly, surfacing higher and higher each time. And then it launches into the air, wings so large they darken the entire sky spreading out, while the Sun reflecting off the creature's glowing hide creates a strobing fireworks display of refracted rainbows.   The being rises higher and higher. Temperatures plummet.  It snows. Then it rains in torrents, but without wind.  As the creature disappears over the horizon to the south, a strong westerly wind pick up and they take up an accelerated pace back towards home. 
Timeline

Action --&gt; Following from chapter 12.
Beauty

The great enigma arises.
Humor

The pettiness of the crew's arguments over booty compared to the incomparable enigma and the mysterious jars leads them to laugh at themselves. Being bowled over by the taste of honey sweetens the joke.
Truth

The unarmed man holding a lantern in Caravaggio's "The Taking of Christ". Is it Judas with sadness and regret in his eyes? Is it the keeper of the garden, astounded by what he sees?   How do any of us know how to react in the face of the sublime?
Impact

A zen moment.

            <Title>Waleran's Rest</Title>
            <Text>Waleran read Birakay’s message again. Then made a dozen copies for sending out with the next bunch of runners.  

Stay still and wait for them to return.  That’s what Luvkando’d said to do. Just stay out of sight and wait for them.  

A close look showed rations left added up to two weeks worth of beast jerky and road gruel. Waleran’s tummy growled at the discovery.

Was Birakay’s message was true? Or a fantastic malark dreamed up before ascending, if that was to be believed. Waleran conjured up a phantasm of the image, doting especially on Birakay’s infectious grin as he faded away into the mists, carried off on the bridge of the Chrome Ark.

Yeah, fair play. Give the starman a full run, Waleran mused.

The light faded to dusk as he finished scribbling the last of the copies. Ehewing studiously on a bite of good Jivákalani beest jerky, it was a small comfort to gaze at the fading phantasm. To recall that scene as night was falling, alone in a strange woods said to be full of dangering-folk, far from the warm homelands of far southern Barbarana.

Waleran’d hard tones playing from the hidden Kahila watchtowers of the Barbakol forest. It didn’t sound like Aranzen Doribah, the singing language Waleran knew well. And it sounded nothing like the garbled Arqq drumming that the Alfer’s and other half-baked rebel groups liked either.  

There’d been snippets of song too, lilting sporadically through the distant woods.  Hard to make  out. Possibly a ritualistic Old Sogomsh that one can hear in the River Temple of Barbol during quadrennial liturgical celebrations of the River-Soul. Yet more distant than that. Resonant of optimism, but with a melancholic rather than triumphant uplift.

Waleran lit the tip of his brightwand and consulted the day’s star-telling charts.

This is ludicrous. He sniffed and snorted, trying to make light of the reading and of his sense that somebody out there in the dark might be watching him. 

I need to keep moving. Get through the Kahilakol. Pass through the Juujal. Get into Rutonijal without getting snatched.  Deliver a copy of Birakay’s lyrics directly to the contact in Rútonik. Get across the river into Eibar. 

Righty-oh. Great waters, I wish B'arqo was here with me.

Then what? Head on up into the battle zone north of Big Tree. Get past the Most Loyal Volunteers and their pharking mercenary thought-cops. Pharking Dorq Tagabant meat-eaters. Hook up with Mur’ray and the Big Tree Heliop Volunteers. 

Easy-peasy. Rolling on the Setta. 

And if. When. No, if. No, if I should get snatched they’ll find Birakay’s little poem here is not exactly “brightly rendered sapient-realist literature”.  I’ll end up at the next Gleaming as the star attraction.

So. I can’t get caught. That’s all. Moons runes!  Wish I could’ve just handed this off to the Independent Scribes of Pavan Bar.  B'arqo said they’re the best in the business.  And he knows things.  

Could get it translated into Sogomsh and Eibar and the ‘barqs. Baybe a few of the little ‘berks too. Then once the Bards start to spread it around… Who knows?   It’ll spread along the rivers, all around the Ring, maybe to other lands.  Perhaps it’ll mean something to somebody somewhere. Then. Stars ’n jars! Yeah! That’s the song.  

Hmmm… Maybe I could earn a few aybets too. I’ve heard they pay well for good material in Pavan Bar.  Argh.  Nah. Can it, you old dodger. Can’t waste time heading to the coast. Luvkando’d turn a Pavan cow.  I’d never make it across into Pavanarune anyway. Damn Tagabant’s scanners’d pick me off the moment I left the forest. 


Calm yerself, wizard. Plenty of wanderers and refugees and Fool-Knows-Who’s scurrying all around in these Barbakal woods.  Don’t worry.  No fear. Trust the Stars. Those message-runners will be back before too long. Good runners too. Freaky-deaky little rabbit-people.

Feeling the heft of its holster, Walleran’s next comforting thought concerned the two boxes of good metal Borded slings nestled at the bottom of his kit.  

My lucky night when I got a rapid peg-slinger from that Norgyte bang-runner at the Candlemakers Hall in Jivákala.  Ha! What a character. What was the name? Shloe-Thirteen? Kept talking about the bear-riders he used to run with. Yikes. I’ll need it though. Probably.  Oh Jexa! Oh Mother of Mercy!  What am I saying?  I mean hopefully not, hopefully won’t need it. 

Probably will though… Shits on a sun dial. I should do some practice shooting.


(Not sure where this might fit in. And it needs work..)

Birakay’s new song spoke in the elliptical and poetic prose of well-crafted Eibar, of the Riders and the Heliops, and of the Kahila, the Byerunics and Mabalbesqs, of all the various tribes, travelers and refugees putting aside their differences in order to turn back on a hideous onslaught of shadowy creatures.

As dark clouds roll in from the Ilyushan Mountains, lovers of knowledge from the ancient traditions meet to find common ground.  Waleran pondered the brutal conflicts he’d witnessed during his travels with B'arqo.  Enough of a star-math to accurately predict when fine words might be the prelude to serious fireworks.


Despite singing fine songs, he muttered to himself, people can be real shits. The finest words can lead to the greatest betrayals. The ancient legends say that a raven-sint will befriend a wolf-sint just in order to tease it and steal its breakfast…  Out of old nervous habit, he looked around to see if anyone might’ve heard him mention the long-extinct flying species — something that can get a traveler in trouble in a Heliop town, and laughed-at in many others.


Fatune had set beyond the western treeline. Waleran peered through the leaves for a glimpse of the night sky, trying to read the position of the far wanderers.  A falling star on the eastern horizon caught the astrologer’s attention.  A quick calculation. A quietly-breathed chant to the Goddess of the Seventh Wanderer. A careful listen for its mental echo. He concluded that the Goddess was preparing a love potion for all the demented hucksters of the Saskan Lands. 

How had that verbose smarty-pants Engineer Quinn put it? “With their outmoded belief systems and lousy bio-programming, their disease has become malignant. Any healing potion might take a long while to effect a cure.” 

Waleran breathed a melancholy sigh. 

I guess that’s a kind of optimism, he thought, eyes fluttering to a close. 

Resting in the certainty that cool, defiant, courageous ones. Like oneself. Like Birakay and Lukando. Like B'arqo. Like Phoenix Stanley Quinn and his friend, that argumenter from Byenung, Showan Biver-Wing. Like all the wise, brave, courageous, talented performers and players and teachers.  Soon we’ll be able to turn the present disorder into opportunity.  To make our way to safe harbors and good havens. We’ll enjoy one another’s company until the love-potion begins to work.  

Drifting off, Waleran imagined the watchtowers of all the great towns announcing a special song sung by the handsome talented Pilot of the Chrome Ark, Birakay of Qurol. Sung for all those carrying their hidden torch lights in the caves of resistance. A great Hum will arise across all the Lands of Saskantinon.

His thoughts picked up on his standard starry mantras as he drifted into sleep.

The true reading will be revealed.
All one has to do is be cool and courageous. 
A little patience goes a long way. 
Follow the purple light of the deep knowledge.  

Imagining all the bards around the Ring singing the new tune, as Waleran drifted off, the wafting of a distant song still playing in his head.


At a hidden turtle-sint campground two clicks to the northwest, the ancient Dance of the Declaration of the River’s Springs continued to unfold. A very, very slow-moving but deeply rhythmic Terrapina bop, it dancer-singers send out waves of gentle sonorous tones aimed at soothing the listener’s sorrows. Like a souvenir of happier times that settles the tremors of a troubled mind.

            <Text>Lots of strong, interesting characters are being defined, which is great. Continue to develop each one of them.


Do  more to align each one to a story arc, to categorize, to balance...

- Assemble a cross reference or a graph of Acts/Chapters/Scenes where each character appears. Who are really the main characters based on that?

- How many male/female/other, gay/straight/other, good/bad/ambiguous characters are there?  Old/young/middle aged?  Children?  How many huum vs. sint vs. Machinic vs. biologic vs. extraterrestrial? 

- I have studiously ignored racial characteristics of the huum characters. Is that workable? Does anything need to be said about their appearance?

- Are any of the names jarringly out of place? 
- Maybe --&gt; Jesse K? Calley Coola? Biff?  ..of Romperondo?  
- Does a reader get the right feeling from their names?
- "Roll up" more info about the characters who are only lightly sketched now. See if that helps. 
- Where and how can naming move away from a "D&amp;D" kind of feeling towards a Dickensian humor when it comes to names and character archetypes?

- In-depth sketches of each character can only help. Drawings. Considering what would be their musical theme. 

- What real-life or historical people could be models, at least partially, for these characters.

 - What characters don't add to the action? Any who could be combined? Who need to be broken out into more than one?

- In reading thru the character sheets, a number of them are defined in terms of what kind of description they bring of various settings. If they don't also bring action and feelings and humor, then set them aside until there's a story that really involves them. Every character needs to do something interesting, not  just be in the story in order to describe something. If/when I need a Big Radio Voice, use one of the narrators or -- hey -- how about a character who is literally a big radio....  Hmmm...

- Don't be afraid to be gay/alternative. If it is a big part of the story, make it big and bold. 

- For every character, there needs to be -- along with actions, feelings, humor, beauty, a distinct voice, and so on -- also an aspect of the story arc that puts them in mortal danger.  Few things are more fun to read about than how a character was faced with a terrible danger and overcame it. Even if they are minor characters, make their personal story compelling.

Role in Story
One of the oldest towns. Close to the eastern border and the Krbsh Sea. Get a taste of travelers from afar.

Related Characters
A number of characters who play a role in the Saskan Lands but come from outside of it arrive via Ingar. May also be a place where defectors, escapees go to — who are considering emigration. 

Season
Typically humid. 

Unique Features
Something of a safe haven for inbound and outbound refugees. Since it is so foundational to Eibarian culture and language, it is difficult for fundamentalist Sun worship to get a foothold. Think of its relation to mainstream Beshquohukian Heliocastronism as something like that of Iran prior to the mullah regime and/or maybe Turkey to the Sunni-Arab-Islamic world. Yes, we are believers, but with our own rich history and traditions thank you very much.  

Description

While not one of the largest towns, it has a lot of traffic, with three roads in and out and close to two major bends in the river. Also close to the border with Ilyushan. It is one of the few towns that has villages packed around it for some distance, rather than just rural villages and farms.

The Great Holly Temple, featuring a gigantic drooping holly tree at its center, is an ancient elaborate structure that has been built up and around the tree for generations.  It is officially a Fatunik place of worship but the upper floors were appropriated by the High Council of the Eibarfolk many years ago.  

This is a language academy devoted to collecting information about Eibar accents, dialects and so on.  It does not try to enforce a proper Eibar.  On its uppermost floors, it is more like a combination trading company / bank / insurance company, sponsoring multiple types of  expeditions on behalf of its board.  

The “High Council” plays an important role in financing (loans, credits, partnerships) throughout the northern and eastern provinces. It works with Kahila enterprises to some extent, but is very wary of romperi influences.  

Active/devout Heliocastronic membership is low as compared to other Fatunik centers. The Fatune Tagabant is active and visible, but mainly deals with ordinary law/order concerns.  The Dorq Tagabant is seldom heard from, dealing mainly with more obscure espionage concerns.  

The Gleaming is not observed in Ingar.  Instead, there is an annual voluntary public Confession in which Sun worshippers process to the River while chanting mournfully and punching each other in the arm. At the river they perform a ritual bathing, to wash away any “moonful and starry excrescence” that has accumulated during the past year. 

There is an Astrologers Laboratory in Ingar, as well as a variety of small, but well-attended Kahila and Settan temples and meeting-houses scattered throughout the town and its surroundings. Though of course Eibar is not a participant in the Night Hall, there is a First Arrivers community hall -- effectively an embassy from the Runes of Bye -- which seeks to build up good relations between Eibar and the other provinces of the Outer Lands.
Sounds
A busy, active place. Lots of coming and going. Lots of commerce. 

Smell
The occasional foul stench emanating from Ilyushan.

            <Text>
This section may be a set of quick, short cuts. Showing time passing. Touching on many events.

As one group of adventurers -- Zadane (?), Malavorra, Petra Bearbek, Allane — travels to the west, we also get to know more about the Terrapins, Sleeths, Arns, Jacks, Rillbeck the Runner, and other sints and fons, mostly in  the southern lands.  Meet Ma Zada.

The distinction between the Pavan and the Setta comes into stronger focus as comparisons emerge between the two distinct river cultures. We start to understand how they begin to merge in the Outer Lands.

Possibly break out into several sections / small chapters, covering each of the main areas explored.

Something of Gulliver’s Travels or Dorothy's Travels I suppose.  Don't get the narrator’s perspective too confused. If it is too much, move to another novel or short story. Not EVERYTHING has to be in the first book.  And don't let fast changes of PoV get too confusing.

Card Number: 43
+ / -  Main conflicts in this scene.

Back home in Mobalbesq, SPQ and Birakay celebrate the release of bee swarms, arrival of other birds and insects, with a joining ceremony.  It takes place at night, during an auspicious conjunction of several full moons.

Remanj and some (which?) of our favorite characters are there.

Afterward, they quarrel in an Apollonian/Dionysian sort of way. Stan wants to move onto more engineering and scientific work for the benefit of all sentient life. Bir wants to spend more time singing, fucking and strolling through the forests and hills.  

With encouragement from Mikel and Ramona, they agree to find a happy medium.
&gt; &lt;  Main events, resolutions, actions in this scene.

Near the conclusion of the joining ceremony, a great cloud rolls over the sky, blotting out the light of the moons, plunging the night into darkness. After it passes, a wind from the east starts out as a gentle breeze. It continues to pick up as the scene continues. There is discussion about an especially high tide.

Finish 1 --&gt; Zoom in. Some of those bees are not organic. They are machinic bugs.
Finish 2 --&gt; Waves on the shore, much higher than usual.

 Timeline

3 months after Card 42.
Beauty

Show the boys enjoying an intimate (not sexual) moment in an alcove at Mikel's estate, sharing a thought in a conversation that is unheard by others, and a laugh.
Humor

Bir sings a song that only maybe Stan and Remanj would like. Use the old saw about jazz; there are no wrong notes. I don't care who likes it or buys it. At some point, Birikay says, you have to stand up and say, this is what I have to do. 
Truth

A pattern only truly works, fully, when it deals with all the forces that are actually present in the situation. The difficulty is that we have often have no reliable way of knowing just exactly what the forces in a situation are. Furthermore, situations change, forces shift. The fact is that we often have to rely on our feelings more than intellect.  

Impact

The answer lies in action, not in words. What am I doing right now?

            <Text>Notes from the first draft of an opening reel, now tentatively moved to Chapter 2..

	•	Point of view is omniscient? Is that really what I want?
	•	If B. is telling the story, let's make that clear.
	•	When in a narrator's mind make that explicit and explain how we got there.
	⁃	It should be clear who is telling the story at any given time.
	⁃	B'arqo
	⁃	Waleran
	⁃	Allane
	⁃	Showan
	⁃	Azron (or another Agent)

	•	Do we have a big bang moment in the first reel or not?
	⁃	Yes, See Ch. 1 -- Endor and Sella
	⁃	Introduce main characters. Crazy bar scene. Arrest. Flight.

	•	Avoid the passive voice.  Work on more action sentences. Don't describe emotions, feelings or opinions.

	•	Review the "game world" language and dialect structures. Editthem to be consistent
	•	For words from the Saskan Glossary, italicize them?

	•	Chapter Two (former opening) is fun. But it is a lot of background and explication. Has nothing to do with SPQ or the opening story line laid out in the Act I Summary, the Story Arc Summary and the Beat Sheet. Tweak to intersect with "The Full Moons" -- B'arqo was in the bar when the arrest occurred.

            <Title>Kam</Title>
            <Text>Kam
29 seasons • Jivákala

Role in Story
A Fatunik believer and worker.
A worker who awakes to class consciousness, with a sense of humor.

A wise fool. Think Charlie Chaplin.
Kam stumbles into most of the situations in which he gets involved, evaluating their meaning only later.

Goal
Tell a story of both assimilation and emerging identity, as well as fear of being outed.  Keep it complex. Kam does not hate the Fatunik community. He loves it, even though he feels estranged from it. 

His story explains the gender expression culture and politics of the Fatunik communities, which is inter-related with its misogynistic class hierarchies.

A transformative agent in a kind of Daoist tradition.  He is part of the network that ends up introducing flying creatures and constructing flying machines, though he'd had no such intention.  

Physical Description
Hefty, solid with especially muscular legs. Having passed the age of presentation, performed a ritual of exposure, and mated, he presents publicly as male without fear or shame. But expects use of male honorifics only with his work gang subordinates, since he is not in a position of leadership &amp; authority in any other context. 
Personality
Plodding but genuine and big-hearted

Occupation
Carpenter’s gang lead. 

Habits/Mannerisms


Background
Released by his biological parents to a Fatunik brooder house near Khaliro as an infant, Kam was raised in the pre-Beshquain. Juuj-and-Eibar-centered Fatunik tradition.  Although he seemed destined for the Tagabant due to his size and strength, a Traveling Sister of the Way of All Things convinced the brooders to direct him into the Fatunik Carpenters Guild instead.  Once he finished his apprenticeship, the Guild sent him to Jivákala where he works mainly constructing ready-made materials for Volunteer Camps. 

He is the parent of two broodlings resident in Jivákala.

Internal Conflicts
He has some oxen DNA, of which he is aware, though not sure of the details. He has covered up this fact his entire life. His feet are slightly cloven.  Conflicted about whether to reveal this to his offspring. Although he participates in Gleaming activities, it is with concern that some day he may be exposed as star-crossed himself.
External Conflicts
He has been visited twice by the Traveling Sisters since they directed him into the Carpenters as a youth. Both times he was given a mission to build a small but relatively complex piece of machinery (related to gliders, it will turn out) for them in secret, which he did.  One of his mates has discovered this side work and the Watch is now keeping a careful eye on Kam.

Notes

Brooder-raised Fatunik children are not given a family name except in cases where it was requested by the natural parents.  Once they are apprenticed, they are typically referred to by the name of their guild or their title, like Kam Carpenter, and sometimes, often in an abbreviated way, by a location they are closely associated with, like Kam Carpenterjivá.

            <Title>Rillbeck the Runner</Title>
            <Text>Rillbeck the Runner
30-ish • Along the banks of the Pavan

Role in Story
A tasty villain of no particular consequence. Rillbeck the Runner is a powered mixed-sint whom puros love to hate.  

Goal
Rillbeck loves to make funny, satirical versions of the heroic stories and songs about Riders, Tagabants and Volunteers.

Physical Description
Enormously obese but very fast. Rillbeck propels himself quickly along the banks of the rivers and over the water by generating both gas and heat from his body. In effect a fart-propulsion system with malodorous consequences. 

He has the ability to launch a fear-generating sonic attack by expertly imitating the sounds of scary things — wild beasts, barbarians, and eerie other-worldly non-harmonic tones. Not to mention the smell, which is also fearful.

He is quite strong, especially when threatened.
Personality
A bully and a thief.  Has rapacious appetites for food. He is a fence as well.

Occupation
Has a burrow along the River Pavan, between Khaliro and Rutónik where he hides out and stashes stuff.  Commands a small guerrilla of like-minded river rats, meaning part-rat sints who thrive along the river. They have no loyalties.

Habits/Mannerisms
Rude. Boisterous. Loud.

Background
Deeply disturbed, Rillbeck is the result of an experiment gone awry. He has no sense of his parentage. His was wiped at an early age before he escaped into the wild. 

Internal Conflicts
Persistent nightmares. Feels abandoned and un-loved.

External Conflicts
Always on the run.  Hunted by both Rider and Heliop authorities. Not looked-upon kindly by Kahila or romperi groups either.  Petty conflicts amongst the rat-troops too.

            <Text>Sungyte Toon


Type of Location

One of the Tree Jewels of Sungyte, the province's eponymous capital Toon is marked by the Tower of Fatune, a a monument to the Sun that also looks towards the Saskan/Fatunik center in Beshquohuk and oversees the River Pavan as it begins its journey to sea.

Some say that the Tower was also built to see over the Saloss Hills into Borded, though that is quite a stretch of the imagination.

The Tower houses numerous headquarters for Fatunik guild associations. It is effectively the business center for Fatunik enterprises across the region, what in regional parlance is called a "bank" in the sense of "vault" or "collection of assets" -- not so much a lending and savings enterprise in our sense of the word.  As in other towns, such buildings tend to be community centers, administrative headquarters, and quasi-judicial offices as well as places of business.

Role in Story


Relationship to Other Organizations


Description
This all needs work. There are several semi-occluded groups who work quietly, but are not exactly secret. Some of the larger ones...

	◆	Magisters of the Highest Unitary Principle (MHUP) and offshoots
	⁃	See Traveling Sisters, Academy at Terpinol, similar ones

	◆	The Jaxen
	⁃	See discussion on factions within the "Created" community

	◆	The Agency
	⁃	Who we are NOT calling it the "Zeldan Supremacy"
	⁃	But should shape it a bit more
	⁃	The idea is that it is a poorly organized galactic bureaucracy trying to exercise god-like interventions but not succeeding

Smaller ones:
	•	Returner cults - many diverse branches.
	⁃	Intersects with religious/spiritual beliefs.
	⁃	Sometimes a front for adventurers, treasure hunters.


Bitami and romperi gangs and networks.

Quiet, hidden impuros communities like the Sleeths and the Devosh.


Have not come up with something that really feels like a "secret society" in the old Gamma World sense or whatever.  Might be fun to come up with something, but it should fit into the story arc. Don't want to just introduce an unhinged category of "secret societies". May be able to delete this.

Nicknames or aliases: 
Age at start of story: Millenia
Place of origin: Unknown
Location at start of story: 

Role in Story
Intervenes against SPQ's Argument.

Goal
Preserving the secrets of the Enclosure

Physical Description / Appearance
Blue. Etherial. A dark god-like figure of female aspect visually, but with a deep male voicing. Often trapped in a vortex between spaces due to prolonged exposure to faster-than-light travel. Has a good store of hidden wisdom. But is so far beyond the ken of huum and sint that direct exposure could be dangerous to sanity.

Personality
Hard to pin down. Very self-assured. But a bit hard to understand. 

Occupation / Education / Training
With much of the Agency hierarchy, titles and roles are confusing, contradictory and often without solid context. For example, no-one aboard the local outpost on the ASS Visitor knows for what Regent Bud Starga is the Vice. There is no consistent set of god-like figures in the Agency, nor is their a title "Regent". A panoply of them representing the traditions of millions of civilizations flung across the galaxy and beyond populate posts throughout the organization. 

Habits / Mannerisms

Timeline

Action --&gt; Following directly from chapter 9b.
Beauty

Speaking truth to power is a beautiful thing.
Humor

"SPQ not only doesn't believe that the Authority have don't have any real authority, he also refuses to obey them." 
Truth

Parochial people are always threatened by transcendent communitarianism and nothing stops the zeal of a sycophant.
Impact

SPQ's real "crime" is being a "criminal philosopher", particularly with respect to choosing to ignore the nationalism, racialism, speciesism and particularist genealogy of popular authority and focusing his attention instead on the here and now, on observable facts, and on valuing the particular dignity and intelligence of dignified, intelligent entities over the "common historical knowledge" espoused by popular and established mouthpieces of statist authority.

The world-ocean has a single name: Havorra. All seas and rivers are understood to empty into one large world-ocean. In most peoples' minds, the Havorra surrounds the Lands and reaches to the edge of the world (Gavor), where it falls over the edge into the Abyss.

The reality is that it is a large ocean that takes up much of the planet's surface.

            <Title>Petra's Appeal</Title>
            <Text>Petra'a Appeal

[Needs some work w/r/t continuity editing, poetics, and point of view, but a nice start...]

Having seen to the liberation of a cohort of Jaxen, and spent a good amount of time studying the Nature of Things with adepts of the Green, Petra Bearbek seeks for a way to engage the southern Dauni Vakasaqua communities in the great struggle against the monstrous invaders.

She travels the southern lands for several weeks, stopping at every Dauni Vakasaqua village to share her enthusiasm for wind-catching devices.  In more cases than not, her ideas are dismissed as "unnatural" but there were a few, both elders and younger ones, who understood the importance of developing more robust irrigation systems if appreciation for the Dauni Vakasaqua way of life was to ever penetrate the thick skulls and stubborn attitudes of the northerners. 

Through these travels, Petra Bearbek developed a network of contacts amongst the Dauni Vakasaqua and she began to have a deeper appreciation for the songs and legends about Malavorra.  During a trip into the southern reaches of the Weir Lands, Petra Bearbek encountered for the first time the Terrapina Community centered in the ponds and creeks northwest of Low Weir.  After many slow and careful discussions, she began to understand that the fantastic rumors of a "secret town" were more than wild stories. 

She came to know of the existence of the Jexan, a warrior tribe of women, both bek and mixed, who view all of the major forces-that-be in the Saskan Lands as various versions of the same patriarchal nonsense, when they rescued her from an assault by bandits.   Petra Bearbek saw in the Jexan the potential for reducing the Ascendancy of the Empafarasi, to check the power of the Riders, and to potentially deliver a significant blow against the Heliops, whom she had long detested. She was determined to recruit the Jexan not only to assist in defeating the Ilyushan Menace, but to change the political landscape of the Saskan Lands by doing so.

The first part of her plan she spelled out in a message to her mentors in the Green:  

"Esteemed comrades, let us reach beyond the possible and blow our collective breaths on the embers of the impossible.  A concerted campaign of song, speech and occult messaging should be undertaken throughout the southland, especially to the West, where Dauni Vakasaqua are most numerous, detailing in particular the mistreatment of the Feminine Principle -- and of feminine sints -- by the monstrous invaders from the Ilyushan Hills.  We need only tell truthful tales about this Bad Treatment, drawing on facts gathered by our own Agents and by those in whom we trust, gleaned from the frontline fighters and from the refugees now fleeing the Northeast by every means available.

"Our campaign should commence at the earliest possible moment and take Priority amongst all of True Friends of the Green.  We should devise the campaign such that in no more than a Half-Turn of Endor,  Her Majestic Healer and Warrior, the Jexan Mother might receive favorably the following private communication from me.  

I have passed into her area,  have some small influence with her tribe and expect she would be favorable to hearing a song sent by me."


Written in the florid elegant style of the region's songs, PB's missive to the Chief of the Dauni Vakasaqua was passed along by members of the Balancing Bards of the Setta, a traveling troupe whose shtick often involved appearing to float on water or air, balancing on beams, stones and other perches -- and sometimes being cleverly suspended by ropes -- while singing their verses.

A popular and well-connected group, their invitation to Low Weir was brought to them by an emissary of Zadane, who explained that the great healer had set out on a journey to the Northwest to bring comfort and solace to the refugees on the roads. 

In due course, a stage of logs and rocks and a couple of cleverly concealed rope bridges was prepared near a scenic weir made of two huge stones and engineered in such a way, it was said by the locals, that its falling waters played a harmony suitable to accompany any truly fine song.  The Jexan Mother Malavorra and her entourage emerged from the woods just as the company was tuning up.  She motioned for them to proceed using a gesture that could perhaps be described as a small dance in and of itself, her hands flowing in a rotation that culminated in a gesture of acceptance. 

They sang the words that Petra Bearbek had composed, using a localized version of an old Kahila tune made popular by Birakay at a scandalous performance in Qurol in which he had taken on a female presentation and sung a new song -- telling a love story between a northern boybek River Guard and mer-maid who lived in the Setta.  If the legendary leader of Low Weir was aware of the implications of using such a tune, made famous in such a way, she made no sign of it, maintaining a calm, cool composure while listening carefully to the brief presentation.

It went something like this:

"Says your most majestic Jexan Mother
 The Saskan Lands face foes unseen
The Forces of Women must be felt
When the Forces of Men are buckling
Confronting Evil that comes to slay
And seeks to see both bek and sint kneeling
Before the muck of its monstrous spray.

"The voices of the free are harshly 
  Shut by foolish utterings partially
 Thought-out but brashly boasted by bekken
 Who in the coming conflict will play
 The same old games of yesterday
 And omit to think that never again
 Could it be the feminine might which wins the day.

"Lend your aid and wisdom now
  To let all the bekken know
  That victory over the Ilyushanic foe
  By Fatunik force alone
  Means a prelude to a southern war
  Means a song of fire and horror
  For westerly folk, for the forests and the weirs.

"Oh Sisters! Heed the call
 Cry the beloveds' downfall
 Cry the enslaved 
 Cry the abused
 Cry the dispossessed
 Cry the afflicted
 Cry the murdered
 Above all, hear her cry for justice.

"Let the Mother's might be felt
 In this just and terrible fight
 And let not the huffing Riders' cries
 Nor the windy Westerners' claims
 Nor the vain Tagabants' boasts
 Be the bard songs sung for the ages
 Without a woman's word to the wise.

 "I am proudly girlbek
  Whom your wanderers rescued
  In the wild woods of the weir lands
 When I was surrounded by the ill-intentioned.
 I pray on the day I can visit your woodland court
 To share the deepest joys of the true
 To celebrate the victory of the new."

When they were done, Malavorra performed a windmilling hand-motion, flowing in large circles as if gathering up energy from the waters and letting it disperse around her, ending with hands crossed over her breasts, and releasing towards the players a fluttering wave as she and her entourage melted back into the woods.
 

 Six days after the presentation had been made, a lone Rider approached Petra's camp in the Kahila Woods astride a fast beast.  The Rider slowed down and rode once around the camp, singing out several times, "The secret song has been sung! The Ring will be restored.  There will be a Great Dance under the Marriage of Sella and Endor.  Let there be songs to fill the air."

Petra took this as a good sign.  She told her companions that they'd be heading north at daybreak. And to prepare for hardships.

            <Text>Settarun
Also see Setting Sketch

Type of Location

The northern half of the Southern Lands, the Settarun is a broad swath of fertile land south of the River Setta and north of the Ring Road. It borders the Runes of Bye to the east, Barbarana and Terpinol to the south. To the west lies the southernmost part of the Weir Lands, not far from the border with Aranzen. To its north are the Borda Woods and the Kahilabequa Lands.

Demographic Summary

Historical Summary

The Toon of Barbok at the western extremity of Settarun is its municipal and cultural center. Much of the majesty and song that characterizes southern affairs is cultivated there, including the widespread animist believes concerning a world-soul and the living character of the River Setta.

The town lies not too far from Low Weir, which shares a culture similar to that of Settarune, but is even more independent from interactions with the Fatuniks, and from Aranzen, both of which are the source of many visitors to the Toon.

Physical Description

Similar to Bararanna in this sense, Settarun is a vast agricultural area where nearly all efforts go into pollinating and caring for plant-life.  It is a heavily vegetarian society. With multiple irrigation schemes tied to the Setta, along with occasional flooding, it is more fertile than the hotter more southern areas and the source of much of the nutrition and fabric materials used throughout the Lands.

Type of Location

Finfaweshwe is a Fatunik military encampment in Norgyte, between Beet Toon and the fortress of Norgldún, a few klicks south of the border with Wesshewen. Smallest of the 3 military camps on the northern border, it is as much a work camp as a military camp. 

This area is where captives and reprobates are sent to do hard labor mining stones for building materials, sod and peat for fuel and fertilizer, as well as planting, harvesting and processing root vegetables. The "village" of Finfaweshwe maintains order in the surrounding countryside, which is presented to outsiders as something of a Potemkin Village for the rehabilitation of "savages".

Card Number: 38
+ / -  Main conflicts in this scene.

After defeating the Ilyushan, the Rider &amp; Allied forces turn south and take on the Lohrnites as the Volunteers dissipate, many of them remaining in the Northeast to help with recovery and rebuilding of defenses. Some of them begin to pay attention to the healer, Rollo of the Dexelites (introduce him earlier), a Returner who says little but has a sublime influence on people. The most conservative and traditionalist of the Fatuniks retreat to Ingar, where Galtreq and others put up a heroic stand against the Ilyushan (need to fit that in earlier).

The representatives of the Pollinators Quest (which needs a better name... This is a small army in itself) reach Juuj, where they are greeted by a sympathetic faction of the Elders (who are actual characters... With names...).

Both Rivers begin to rise precipitously. The Eelani release of dammed waters plus the torrential rains have created flood conditions along both banks  Levees are broken, the rivers are re-aligning, streams are created connecting the rivers. (And we see all this from whose point of view? What actions does it cause? And how are they tied into the story arc(s)?)

Tonedo, along with several candlemakers and Lohrnites, but not Lohrn himeself, are killed by assassins. Some of the killers are Kahila. Others are wolves. Others are Untamed. Others are taken down by resistance fighters leading crowds of the Afflicted.

A popular uprising, sometimes peaceful, sometimes violent, spreads across the Fatunik provinces, driving out or leading to a revolt of the Tagabant in several towns. (Point of View? Particulars? Sights. Sounds. Smells.) 

The authority of the old Center collapses (how does that manifest?). A group of Reformed Scribes (which is what? Where did that movement get started?) occupies the Temple in Beshquohuk after posting a list of their Intentions on its Great Door.
&gt; &lt;  Main events, resolutions, actions in this scene.

Montage of those who died. Memorials, funerals, remembrance gatherings. 
Mourning accompanies victory.
There are battles still to be fought, contradictions still unwinding.
(And I need specifics, characters, action, dialog, not generalities and descriptions... :-) )

Finish --&gt;  SPQ is freed and reunited with Birakay. There is an erotic moment, unconsummated (see "Humor" below).

 Timeline

Continue directly from Cards 37, with memorial montage recalling moments from earlier.
Beauty

The joy of a successful popular uprising, seasoned with the sadness of fighters lost and the potential for things to go south (which I need to stress a bit more... Note the wolves, the unrecalcitrant Kahila, Lorhn's escape, etc. Perhaps work in some scheming around monetizing, profiting from the Pollination).
Humor

See Act V, Scene IV, of The Two Gentlemen of Verona -- Valentine's soliloquy -- not funny, haha, or even terribly ironic, but an evocative expression of Stanley's feelings at this juncture. We return from that erotic moment, unconsummated, because "I have much to do To keep them from uncivil outrages".
Truth

Sitting quietly, accumulating spiritual energy, giving birth to the dragon's egg, to the spiritual infant, draws in the forces of immortality and healing. SPQ is an anti-hero of the wei wu wei type.  

Impact

Another great sloshing about of yin energy, but mixed with some big yang moments.

            <Title>Act III - Summary</Title>
            <Text>
[Some of these things are hinted at in Act II, which is fine. But need to review, revise to make sure we're not spilling all the beans before Act III.]

Act Three is a Cinderella scenario, with a classy retro sci-fi twist at the end.

Big rise, big fall -- several in quick succession. Stumbling but steady rise. A big fall. A big rise -- several in quick succession.  And a small “stay tuned” fall at the end.

Land and sea flotillas launch towards the Center.  Rompers [name?], bards [name?] and Byerunics lay the groundwork for introducing meaningful change.  It all looks promising and exciting when…


Fall, fall, fall. 


Trouble strikes from multiple directions. An uprising of the bad machines, aimed at huum, sint and dissident Jaxen, launches from the Krunkinotto. Every Jax becomes suspected as an enemy agent. Barbarian gangs and nomads sweep in from the Wesshewen plains. We’ve heard about them over and over. Always it was in a heroic context of protecting the Lands. Now they have arrived to take advantage of the difficult times.  And they are terrifying. [Why? How? Is it just Mad Max, Part 27?] 

The invasion of monstrous shadowy creatures [OK -- need a whole breakdown of what this is all about] from Ilyushan causes major problems in the Northeast. A similar outbreak in the Forgh [this maybe, umm, overkill?] makes waves for our new-found sea-side friends. 

Core political problems come to a boiling point. To be undermining the Riders and the Heliops at this juncture is becoming an unpopular, or at least controversial, move in the heartland provinces of those two power centers. Although there is now widespread upset about Iohane and Henqu, as pretty widespread support for Stanley's Argument, the multiple invasions along with Tonedo's propaganda campaign against Allane and Kaharan means the sentiment of seeing dissenters as emboldening the enemies at the gate is growing. 

Resistance slows down and comes to a halt in some areas. It is betrayed, and not only by the Old Jaxen among them.  This all happens rather quickly, like a car crash or a chase scene. 

There is trouble everywhere as a new, more complex, synthesis begins to take shape. 

Resistance is redirected to the defense of the lands. The sea forces, with their Seffy intelligence agents, bitamin militia leaders and _flying_ fighters starting to arrive from the faraway islands energize the drive to push invaders back into the Forgh, back across the Ilyushan ridge, and pushing up against the Ilyushan wave itself. 

The regular Riders and Fatunik Volunteers defend the Northeast against both barbarians and machines. The bitamin and Kahila, along with many sint volunteers coming up from the southern Outer Lands and beyond to join them, go to the rescue of towns in the Northeast, providing a front-line against the horror pouring down from the Ilyushan Mountains. We see the gentle heroism of folks like Zada, Remanj and Rollo. 

Far from the center of things, assistance arrives from Aranzen to help the Eelani and other dissident Riders, the Empafarasi, the Dauni Vakasaqua  and the New Jaaxen turn back a flanking southern attack from the Krunkinotto. The conflict in the southwestern hills has drawn in the Freeborn Riders of Eelan, who become aware of the considerable advances, discoveries and alliances that have developed due to the machinations of the Academy, the Traveling Sisters, the Moballeq Clan, the New Jaxen and others. They defect en masse to the western alliance, ending an of the most ancient  harmonies amongst the major huum tribes.

There is trouble in the Center too.  A showdown escalates to an intellectual breaking point pitting the Elders of Juuj against the High Council of Beshquohuk, and between Beshquohuk and the Fatunik-leaning Outlanders. The eldest advisors to the Heliocastron and the most senior and learned associates of the Reformed Byenung Academy of Historical and Juridical Cacography are nearly to the point of raising swords against each other. Both sides have been influenced by the occult scholars of Terpinol, especially the interventions of Waleran Tanaraka and the 'Immortal' B'arqo the Wanderer.  

How will the contradictions be resolved?

Occulted incognito Agents are being exposed. Agents loyal to Bud Starga are being exposed by the rogue agents we’ve come to know — Azron, Calley Coola, Jesse K. They also reveal themselves, to some extent, in order to influence the debate. Telling parables about worlds that could not be rehabilitated following their Catastrophical Era due to various flavors of bone-headedness. There is open conflict among regular agents too, many starting to openly contradict Vice Regent Bud Starga, adding to the tension.


Rise. Fall. Even harder


Allied Rider and Heliop forces win key victories in the North and Northeast, driving back the barbarians and the machines.  Orders go out from Beshquohuk to arrest and subdue the bitamin, Kahila and sint forces in the Northeast.

Fatunik Volunteers start moving en masse East to take over the battle the biggest threat of all -- the Ilyushan wave of terror. Debates in Beshquohuk are interrupted by a team of scribes organized by Tonedo.  They lie so fast, so loudly, with such felicity — introducing a new school of argument called the New Theology of Post-Catastrophic Optimism — that the Elders of both schools are taken in by it.  The New Thinking is not new at all, rather a concentrated and re-packaged version of all the old fears and hatreds.  The New Philosophers announce the initiation of a New Gleaming, doubling down on order for a pogrom, more or less, directed at non-believers, "crypto-Fatuniks", Kahila-folk and sints.

Attorneys and disputants from the Byenung Academies despair. They consider leaving, fearing for their safety.

Higher level Agents begin drawing pessimistic up reports requesting that the planet be scheduled for a downgrade -- a lost cause.


Rising.  With difficulty. 


Sea-monsters retreat from the Forgh. The Old Jaxen return to their caverns in the western mountains, driven back at least in part by the EMT pulse cannons and other electromagnetic innovations introduced by the "mages" from Aranzen. 

Flotillas make their way to all the ports and landing sites, and start heading up the Pavan and the Setta, preparing now to defend the Kahila folk, Outlanders and Southerners.

The Night Hall makes an official break with the Center, and announces support for a counter-offensive against the New Gleaming as reports begin to come in of the first massacres perpetrated against bitamin and Kahila led squadrons in the Northeast. 


Rising.  With determination. 


The Rider High Council in Borded refuses to have anything to do with the New Gleaming.  But does not offer help in securing the Northeast or defending non-huum sints and other heretics, does not announce its support for the Declaration of the Night Hall.

They are confronted by a mass of free riders from Eelan and their fellow travelers, who have been generating a kind of general strike throughout the Rider Lands as they approached Borded, following their victory over the Old Jaxen

 They insist that a multi-sided alliance makes the entire region more secure. They argue that the combined  forces of Empafarasi units, the sea forces arriving in the East, and the masses of Eelani, Kahila and various southern volunteers could defeat both traditional Rider and Heliop ground forces if it were to come to that, echoing the ancient rhetoric of the civil war that ended with the Wall of Fire. 

Rise. 

The Riders -- at last -- agree. B'arqo makes a dramatic appearance at the Great Debate still being held at the Box in Beshquohuk, now focusing on arguments being presented by Showan and other Byenung representatives. 

He offers a New Vision to the assembly.

A Rider / Eelan force charges across the Northeast, causing complete panic in the Fatunik rear and disrupting attacks against the Kahila folk. Together the Riders, the Heliops, the Kahila, and the the Empafarasi along with those who came from across the Krbsh Sea drive back both the monster hordes and the revanchist Heliops.

Rise. Balloons, kites, banners, gliders — and birds and bees and flying bugs of all kinds — are seen all over Saskantinon, to the astonishment of the Heliops and the Agents, who scramble to rewrite their reports once again.  

There is a tremor, followed by a torrential downpour, then sunshine.  Oh happy day. The mandate of heaven has shifted. Stan and Birakay unite and are hailed as the Princes of the New Age. Showan and Ramona start a family.  There is an exodus of Agents from the local star system, with only a few rogues and reporters left behind.

Coda.

In bucolic Low Weir, Zadane stumbles upon the entrance to yet another cave. Wandering in, she falls into an entrance to the underground labs beneath the town, where the "mystics" of Aranzen are helping their northern colleagues in a variety of experiments.  

On a remote isle in the Remari Archipelago, Cereb [name], a whale-firebird,  arises and surveys her domain. She is the size of several islands. She creates the wind.  As she passes over Wing Island, a huge tree erupts from the ground. It grows and grows and grows, threatening to blot out Fanon's light. From the tree, tens of thousands of insects, snakes and small birds dart out into the sky. And at last, small monkeys.

Far beneath the Krunkinotto, a spy-Jax who had been embedded with the dissidents to the south reports to Control, displaying diagrams and blueprints of flying machines. The unflappable analysts of the Created feed the new data into a system that is designing what look like near-orbital trajectories. The pod are testing something that looks like rocket fuel.

Description

The group who are primarily taking on the need to do manual pollination. They send workers throughout the lands to manage and conduct this kind of work. 

Secondarily, they work in all levels of agriculture, trying to improve techniques to develop better strains, for aquaculture and hygronomy methods, for grinding and processing of grains and roots, and in development of healthy and potent varieties of s'lah.

Dominant social force in the southern provinces of Settarun and Barbarana, as well as Selessaluga in the Weir Lands.

A much more amorphous, fluid, dynamic kind of organization than the Riders Union, the Authority or even the Night Hall. Considerably more self-organized, voluntarist in nature, operating largely without formal structures through many, many layers of personal contact. Heavily matriarchal but not exclusionary.

Historical Summary
Considered to be the origin-point for huum settlement of the Saskan Lands, Eibar prides itself on having the original "correct" pronunciation of the northern language. Its great Toon of Ingar is considered to be the Citadel protecting the Pavan.  Sitting on it dramatic rise above the Pavan Gorge, just west of the Rocking Falls, Ingar is well-placed to rain bombardments down on any unwelcome guests navigating up the Pavan from the sea.

            <Title>Henqu</Title>
            <Text>Henqu
26 • Borded

Role in Story
Henqu feels the rhythm tying together events around the Ring. His  insight into the life around the Ring is strong.  Some good humor too. A singing cowboy. Good sheriff in a rough town.  Also see character sketch for Iohane.
Goal
To hear that lonesome whistle blow. To be persecuted for the sake of justice and redemption. To endure a passion and become a savior.

Physical Description
Lanky but physically strong. Male/hetero, officially un-partnered but in love with Iohane. Like all Ring Riders, outward appearance/presentation is gender neutral but not in an obsessive way. Usually seen only well-armored and armed. 

Personality
Reserved most of the time, to the point where some folks think he may have a mystical starry side. Boss-sheriff when necessary. Tries to remain even-headed and even-handed. Feels that both Heliop fundamentalists and Alfie-type extremists are “messing things up for the rest of us”. Drinks too much but sings like an angel.

Occupation
Ring Rider.

Habits/Mannerisms
Correct, somewhat laid-back in a cowboy-detective sort of way.
A knight. A detective. A sheriff in a rough town in the wild west.

Background
From a poor herding family in the Oknott. Left home to reduce burden on the family and escape rural poverty. Easily recruited into the Riders since he already had skills in beast riding and fighting. 

Internal Conflicts
Henqu has become increasingly errant with respect to the Code of the Riders. He has come to understand that he has some mild powers.  Although not strictly forbidden by the Code, it is pretty heavily discouraged and not disclosing one’s abnormalities is a violation of the Oath of Openness.  He loves and admires the Riders Guild and everything that Borded stands for, is worried about his standing if he comes clean, concerned he will be relocated to the outer provinces or assigned a less-responsible task.  Ring Riders, in particular, are discouraged from partnering-up. His evolving relationship with Iohane presents another potential errancy.  As the great conflict erupts and the defection of the Eelan occurs, his loyalties are stretched to the breaking point. (Hmmm... He may be dead by that point. Ooops.)
 
External Conflicts
Henqu is effectively a cop and something of a detective, as well as a spy for the Hosteleries Cooperative and other Rider-affiliated guilds/businesses.  He has had multiple run-in’s with neer-do-well’s, bandits, corrupt officials, bullies, legalistic eager-beavers (sort of literally) who question Rider authority on their section of the Ring, psycopathic Fatunik fanatics, sociopathic Alfie extremists, traumatized refugees, bandit gangs, and so on and so forth. When rebellion erupted in Ríkila, he was torn between sympathy for the Kahila-folk and orders to maintain status quo w/respect to relations between Riders and the Heliocastron.

Story-lines
Would be good to do some sketches (written) showing the kinds of things noted in "External Conflicts".  These may be flashbacks regarding the event in Ríkila.

            <Text>Weir Lands
Westernmost provinces
Role in Story
Most remote part of the Saskan Lands. Mountainous, hilly. Where the Empafarasi and Dauni Vakasaqua have their centers.  The source of both main rivers.  A source of change. The lacunae. The nothing-that-is. The empty set that makes unity always a matter of change and development rather than solidity.

Love. Healing. Honor. Flight.
Related Characters
 

Seasons
In the region around the upper Setta, idyllic rolling waters, hillsides full of plants, flowers, herbs. Not eternal spring, but something like that year-round.  
In the region around the upper Pavan, the highest peaks in the Saskan Lands.  The snowiest region.
Unique Features
The only province that lies in part outside of the more-or-less recognized borders of Saskantinon. More like — the most remote, least centrally-controlled region.  

A good number of fairly well-maintained roads/paths run through the region. 
Description
The name “weir” echoes Anne McCaffrey’s fictional world of Pern, which used “weir”. That could imply in a reader's mind that dragons now live or once lived here.  In my world, this could serve as an allusion to the long-lost knowledge of / desire for flight, but also to incursions of created beings from the realm of the Jaxen.

A weir is a small man-made dam, always with a flow of some kind, often with a fish ladder. Every huum culture builds them. The western Saskan Lands host many creeks, rivers, riverlets and so on and a rich constructed eco-system for irrigation and fishing. 

The Empafarasi of High Weir and the region around the town are key into this part of the story. Work through how to approach this in subtle, interesting ways. It is the only town located on a mountain. And like Low Weir, it conceals some secrets.  Caves/underground installations with allusions to both flying animals and flying machines.   I have a Blender sketch of a crazy kind of tower that could be the castle or observatory or both of the Empafarasi.

Their tower-stronghold is one of the wonders of Saskantinon. It is called the Mistral Tower of the Empafarasi in reference to mistral winds that blow down from the mountains. 
Sights
Main towns are High Weir and Low Weir.  The countryside around these two centers are considered to be the domains, respectfully of the Empafarasi, which is a kind of hereditary house, and the Dauni Vakasaqua, which is the mystical order at the heart of the culture of the Southern Lands.
Sounds
Many small waterfalls, rapids. Lots of non-sentient wildlife, though birds and flying insects are unknown, or at least very rare. Many caves and some cenotes.

Sub-Regions
Although most of Weir Lands is protected by the Empafarasi of High Weir, this is not an officially declared border. The boundaries between their domain on the one hand, and Eelan, Selessaluga, Oknott and the Krunkinotto Lands on the other, are fluid and flexible. The riders of High Weir are sometimes called the Beqawar, which alludes to their ancient role in defending huum (beq) settlements from machinic raiders from the north. This term distinguishing their armed forces from the House of Emparfarasi itself.

	○	Salessalaga, the area around Low Weir in the southern section of Weir Lands, is autonomous culturally from the rest of Weir Lands. It is distinctly feminist, with the women of Low Weir, the leaders of the Dauni Vakasaqua, having a large influence on the surrounding countryside. Known for being full of magic, due partly to its border with Aranzen and partly to its openness to both sentients with powers and to mixed sints of all types.


Notes
Looking for new words or neologisms to use instead of “rider”, “new rider”, “high rider” and so on… highlighted the ones I like the best.

700 words.
NOVEL STANDARD MANUSCRIPT FORMAT
       by Forename Surname

Part One
Chapter One
     Standard manuscript format is often required for novels
so that work can easily be read by editors. It allows editors
to estimate word count and determine roughly how many pages
will be required to produce a book using the page size, style
and font used by their house. This PDF file was generated
using Scrivener's Compile feature and was created using the
"Novel (with Parts)" project template.
     Manuscripts for full-length novels require a separate
title page. The author's name, address, telephone number and
e-mail address should be shown in the upper-left corner of the
title page, single-spaced. The title of the story should
appear in all-caps about half-way down the page. The author's
name follows the title on the by-line as the author wants it
to appear when published. A real name or pseudonym may be used
Surname / TITLE / 1

and may include initials, actual given name or professional
designation.
Surname / TITLE / 2

Chapter Two
     All text should be double-spaced and left-justified with
a ragged right margin. Paragraphs should be indented by about
five spaces (half an inch) and not separated by an additional
blank line. (It used to be traditional to separate each
sentence with two spaces, but in these days of word processors
this is now less common.)
     A 12-point font such as Courier, Times New Roman or Arial
should be used throughout. In Scrivener, however, you can
write using any font and formatting you choose--the options in
Compile can be used to change the formatting in the compiled
document. In the "Novel" project template, the Compile
settings will deal with changing the font and formatting to
those required for standard manuscript format.
     Top, bottom, left and right margins should all be
approximately one inch, not allowing for the page header. Each
Surname / TITLE / 3

page except for the title page should include a header
comprising the author's real surname, the title of the work
(or a key word from the title) in capitals, and the page
number. In Scrivener, all of this is handled for you by the
"Manuscript" Compile formats.
                               #
     Scene breaks are indicated with the hash character. Do
not simply add an extra line space as this can be missed by
the typesetter. The "Separators" pane of Scrivener's Compile
sheet can handle this for you if you are writing each scene as
a separate text document. In general, this will be handled by
Compile in Scrivener, however, so that you can either leave
empty lines in the text (and Scrivener will insert the hash
character during Compile) or use different documents for
different sections (and Scrivener will add the hash between
them).
     Some editors and publishers prefer emphasis to be
indicated by underlining rather than italics. In Scrivener,
this conversion can be handled by Compile. The "Manuscript
(Courier)" Compile format will convert italics to underlines,
whereas the "Manuscript (Times)" format will not.
Surname / TITLE / 4

Part Two
                         Chapter Three
     Begin each new chapter on a new page like this with the
chapter number about a third of the way down the page. In
Scrivener, this can all be dealt with in the Compile settings.
In Scrivener, all of this is handled automatically by the
"Manuscript" compile formats.
     Although it is often said that writers should not use the
word-count features of their computers to determine the number
of words in a manuscript, most publishers and editors will
happily accept a word processor word count these days. In
Scrivener, you can insert a word count of your manuscript by
using Edit &gt; Insert &gt; Draft Word Count (for a manuscript, you
may wish to have the word count rounded to the nearest 100, in
which case select Edit &gt; Insert &gt; Draft Word Count &gt; Rounded
To Nearest 100--this feature is used on the title page of this
Surname / TITLE / 5

manuscript, in fact).
     Note that the actual word count will not be inserted, but
a tag that will be substituted for the word count upon export.
In reality, the formatting of a manuscript is often only
really crucial when submitting directly to a publisher--first
time novelists will usually submit to an agent first, and
agents are often less picky about format and will point you in
the right direction before submitting your work to a
publisher.

            <Text>B'arqo uses connections with Inn Keepers, Empafarasi, Kaharan/Dauni Vakasaqua, Henqu, Iohane and others to create a popular journal, something never seen before.

The Saskan Times (hmmm, do better!) is an illustrated folio (8 pages), written mostly in Eibar with some articles in Sogomsh. It is published weekly, sold in the towns mostly via Free Innkeepers. At 10 aybets a copy, only the wealthy can afford it, but it is passed from hand to hand, each copy read many times and often read aloud as well. In some places, parts of it are reproduced as broad-sheet style paintings. 

It contains news of goings-on in the towns and in the country side, as well as lyrics to and/or reviews of new songs or modifications to classic bardsongs. 

Published in High Weir with stories, news, drawings collected by Barqalot’s far-flung network and brought to the west by various means. Some gossip and innuendo is included, along with heroic depictions of characters in our story.  It provides a kind of story-within-the-story mechanism, and is a story-line in itself. 

Its reporting is not always entirely accurate.  “The Passion of Henqu” is a recurring series that became widely popular, which eventually contributes to the revolt following Henqu's passion in the fires of the Gleaming.

The journal also popularizes Birakay and promotes him in the role of The Arqan Pilot, which is blasphemy for Fatuniks.

Malavorra joins the characters moving around the southern Ring, intersecting with the storyline regarding Kaharan and Allane. Picking up from the death of a candlemaker, we move further south and west.

Petra Bearbek, who is moving on a completely different trajectory, enters the tale, throwing yet another twist into things, introducing more new ideas, approaches to things. She is a hero.  Malavorra, a giantess, represents in a sense the old gods and titans, and is effectively a sidekick to Petra Bearbek. 

(Look at some of the Greek legends for more inspiration on Malavorra and Petra Bearbek.)

A vignette on Snek occurs in this chapter, providing a perspective that is even farther removed from the main ones. In the case of Snek, it is largely for humorous effect bit also as a chorus to reflect — however oddly — the flaws and so on of the more central characters and a Daoist sense of stillness and calm and grounded earthiness in the midst of the chaos.


There is movement in two directions.

Barq and Otto travel counter-clockwise from Borded to Eelan, where they stir up concern that the Wall of Fire could be re-ignited.

Malavorra and Petra (and Kaharan and Allane) travel clockwise from Bordakal to Harvestun. They cross paths on the Ring west of Bordakal.

(This is probably two scenes -- one in the East, one in the West.)

Customs officials, traders and others are surprised when the adventuring sea crew returns missing most of their crew and carrying mostly some huge jars that they refuse to open.  Which turn out to be bee hives that they insist on delivering to different parts of the realms.

They also bring honey, which causes a sensation and causes an economic bubble to rise.

&gt; &lt;  Main events, resolutions, actions in this scene.

The Sea Tagabants at Pavanarune are surprised when raven sints begin flying in, one by one.
And then are appalled when they are followed by flocks of pigeons and gulls, squabbling and carrying on, as they do.
We literally rise out of hole. The first balloons rise. 

The first birds return to Saskantinon as the ship returns to harbor.  
===

A Mobalbesqan naval flotilla that includes our intrepid voyagers returning from Wing Island stops at the Setta Delta to pick up advisors from The Runes of Bye, then at Selaron to drop off supplies for the defense of Ríkila, along with other trade goods. 

As the ships approach the Bay of the Pavan, they spot creatures pouring into the Sea from the Forg and the Ilyushan.   

The landing at the Towers of the Pavan Bar is done surreptiously and quietly, with many of the non-huum sints and allies recruited from the realm of the Delphine Queen swimming up the river towards Ingar rather than exposing themselves to detection by Heliops at the Pavan Bars.

Warriors led by Mikel Moballeq (?), Gallex (?) and B'arqo (?), recruited in the Outer Lands, are moving northwards, starting to arrive in the Pavan Bay area at the same time that the ships are arriving. 

Local authorities examine the documents provided by Luvcando the Shanowan,while  the Sea Watch at the Pavan Bars is thrown into shock when they see ravens flying towards Ingar.  

They are even more appalled when gulls and pigeons start arriving on the docks, arguing and carrying on, as they do.

===

Continuing to explore the underground tunnels of the western lands, plans are revealed for gliders, kites, balloons, parachutes.  A blimp emerges from the Eelani Hills.

All those kinds of things that have been carefully denigrated and misdirected by the Agents have been subtly encouraged by the dissident Jaxen.

Need to review previous chapters -- who has actually stumbled on the caverns? Do Dex and Biff come back into the picture? 

Get a little more clarity on where the caverns are. Is that Empafarasi territory? Eeelan? Borderlands between Jaxen base and High Weir? Are they further south? There should be dissident Jaxen enclaves,  and perhaps project of collaboration between the Eelani and the Empafarasi where they've been working on flying machines. (Later, we find out even more is going on -- and why the Empafarasi need the skills of the miners. Maybe foreshadow that a bit.)

Let’s get a butterfly resuscitation theme going too. But keep it occluded, mysterious. Possibly tied to Aranzen. I am thinking cenote-like caverns much further to the south. All of these echoing the earlier themes of underground activity beneath the Pool at Juuj.

Jax Remanj, having broken free of collective programming, and their pod, have started a movement to collaborate with Dauni Vakasaqua, Empafarasi and Mobalbesqan engineers. The Free Jaxen movement grows and develops.

Engineering bees back into life, turning the “scary bugs” motif around in a fun surprise. The “aliens” (Agency) are a hopeless mess, they caused some of the main problems and support some of the most reactionary forces in the Lands. A faction of the home-grown “enemy” (Jaxen/AI) are more forward-thinking than most of the biological life-forms.  This is a surprise twist -- bit of a slow burn the way I have it set up so far, but at least it turns the traditional Gamma World version of that story around. I also like the Seth MacFarlane-ish approach to the celestial overlords -- the "Star Trek" folk did intervene -- and fucked everything up.

Finish --&gt; Arrival of pigeons and gulls on the docks at [Pavanarune Toon]. 

 Timeline

Action --&gt; Culminating all the main activities in Act II. The flying machines in the west join the Army assembled in the Eelani Hills. The first bees are released in Mobalbesq as the Outer Land Volunteers march north. A butterfly appears in the south lands. A swarm of mechanical bugs torment Tornedo.  
Beauty

The first taste of honey (again). Astonishment that flight can happen.
Humor

The pigeons and gulls making a cacophonous mess, reflecting the chaos that ripples through the Agency.
Truth

Technology can be used for both good and evil. 
Impact

A big rising, an uplifting feeling, joy in the morning. The good guys might just win. Our various heroes might just overcome death.

            <Title>Tonedo Remper</Title>
            <Text>Tonedo Remper
The Judge of Juuj
The Grand Tagabant 

Age at start of story: 
60 something

Place of origin: 
Village of Remper, in the Borda Woods. 


Location at start of story: 
Juuj

Role in Story
Tonedo is the main antagonist to SPQ and others. He is the accuser who brings charges of heresy against the scientist, and by implication against all of Mobalbesq and friends.  The chief driver of persecutions carried out at the Gleaming, and throughout the year. Head of what amounts to both the secret police and the department to protect virtue and punish vice, Tonedo is responsible for maintaining order in the Heliop lands, as well as for spreading the Heliop faith and combatting all forms of heresy.

He epitomizes puro disdain for sints and uses every opportunity to characterize difficult situations faced by inhabitants of the Saskan Lands as having been caused by the dire influence of the mixed population. He never ceases preaching of the dangers posed by creatures of the  darkness and so on.  

His ability to rile up the faithful is a major source of recruitment for the Watches, but also for the Volunteers. The invasions from the Ilyushan Mountains play right into his hands. 

He is responsible for the executions of Iohane and Henqu at the beginning of the story, and for the attempted assassination of Birakay later in the story.

Goal
To root out hidden sints from the Heliop strongholds and to expand the borders and safe zones surrounding them. To expose and combat revisionist views of Fatunik traditions as found, especially, in the Arguments put forward by The Runes of Bye, by Mobalbesq thinkers and by various syncretic believers — but also to draw a sharp line between Fatunik and anti-solar thinking, which is his way of criticizing the Empafarasi and the Eelani. 

His paranoia is such that it promotes the idea that any supposedly puro huum who is not a devout Heliop is probably hiding their starry or animal nature. He is suspicious and critical of all new thinking and detests new songs.  He views gender expression as a weakness that must be endured under specific conditions. His armed retinue / house guard are all biological women.

He is often at odds with the more pragmatic elements of the Authority, who sensibly value their somewhat fragile, sometimes profitable alliance with the westerners, Borded especially, as well as the relative peace with the southeastern provinces, and have no desire to re-ignite either the old civil war or a new one.

Physical Description / Appearance
Severe, thin, balding. Very tall and very strong. Has an affected accent that he thinks sounds like ancient, supposedly "proper" Eibar. Likes to use his long arms to great dramatic effect when speechifying. Has a hypnotic effect on people around him.

In fact his "proper" Eibar is occasionally inflected with hints of the Sogomsh that many of his villagers spoke when he was a child. 

Personality
Unctuous in the extreme.  Hates everything. Disagrees with everything. Never encounters an argument he won’t disagree with. A bully. 

He is fearful of everything and everybody.  Paranoid. But at the same time convinced that he is not paranoid because, which is true, there really _are_ monsters out there.  The world really is going to shit. There really are "heretics" of all kinds surrounding the Fatunika on all sides.

Occupation / Education / Training
His uncle was the chief judge of Juuj before him. He was trained from childhood in Fatunik Thought and Argument, entering the Scribes of the Noon-Day Sun at young age and quickly advancing to more senior positions.  Although his official position in the Guardians is not public, he is widely assumed to be the head of the Dorq Tagabant, the Candlemakers and the Specials. He also commands the Meyajo Tagabant, a group devoted to ferreting out spies, infiltrators and so on, as well as keeping an eye on the level of devotion exhibited by Fatunik officials. 

He is erudite, well-versed in Saskan history, but from an extremely prejudiced Fatunik point of view. Can read and understand multiple languages, but is never heard to speak anything except his version of "proper" Eibar.

Habits / Mannerisms
A devoted carnivore, he makes a point of eating animal flesh and relishing it, nearly to the point of obscenity. He is openly disdainful of people who openly express either male or female gender. Adopts the official Fatunik gender-neutral look in his dress.  

Is incapable of forming a loving relationship, something that has isolated him from his family. Occasionally has relations with members of his retinue, but is not known to have spawned a brood.

Background
One of his grandmothers was a coyote-sint, something that is well-known in the village, but kept secret as much as possible in Tonedo’s public life. This may explain some of his psychological make-up (self-hate). He may also have a mild power of suggestion. 


Views and Perceptions
- on art, museums, monuments, icons, representation
He is against everything, a true iconoclast. His distate for music and song is one of the things that make him unpopular even amongst the faithful.
- on enclosure, zookeeping, control, rescue, freedom &amp; necessity
He utterly rejects any suggestion of enclosure or agency activity as starry nonsense aimed at undermining the authority of the Authority and the denying the centrality of Solar Power.  He sees recovery of the Lands as something that will happen once a sufficient number of its residents adopt the true thinking and cast away sinful ways.  He's pretty much a genocidal maniac.
- on big other, petit objet a, realness, death drives
The sint-spawned are his Devil, whom he perceives as responsible for bringing division and disobedience, resulting in land-illness. His desire is for a pure land that has been cleansed of infiltrators. He believes that only Eibar correctly names the things of the world and of the mind, while other languages are debased. 
- on benevolence, difference, events
The Arguments of The Runes of Bye are a constant source of aggravation for Tonedo, who would like to see them all overturned. A vulgar ideologue, he has virtually no appreciation for dialectic, variation, difference or evolution. His understanding of major events all focus on victories and defeat for the Authority. He is utterly ignorant of the ecological and biological problems that Engineer Quinn presents.
- on music
See above. He finds Birakay, who considers himself a devout and devoted Heliop, and is a popular emissary of modern Fatunik culture, to be a most dangerous person, infected with bad tones.
Internal Conflicts
A sadist.

External Conflicts

Specific Conflicts

- Love

- Ethics

- Self-Sacrifice

- Ecocide / Planetary healing


Theme
Not quite a Darth Vader theme. He is a good bit less cosmic than that, more pathetic than Wagnerian. Maybe something in the zone of that droning Arabic style of music, or maybe just some jangling of bells (and chains? Or tocsins/woodblocks?).
Other Notes

- Generally speaking, I have a lot of protagonists and not very many antagonists. Lots of good guys, but not so many bad guys and the ones I have tend to be vague, amorphous others. Need to use Tonedo as the foil, the tip of the spear, for the bad-guy Heliops. When they are defeated in Act Three, we need to see his downfall. And we need to see his side kicks and cohorts.

Role in Story

Some humor, some tragedy. A mirror reflecting/refracting the questions about consciousness and relationships between different kinds of living beings.
Goal


Physical Description / Appearance

Of course the introduction of pollinators and winged creatures -- birds, bees, insects, butterflies, moths -- is a major part of the story.   Introduce birds of prey at the very end, as part of the traditional ruh-roh sci-fi ending.

But there are other animals too who have not achieved the level of consciousness evident in the Untamed...
Some are fairly domesticated -- cats, dogs, raccoons, squirrels, chipmunks. mice, rats
Some are pretty much or partly enslaved or treated mainly as a food source -- pigs, sheep, horses, various types of lizards used for food, fish, worms
Some are wild and dangerous -- jaguars, bobcats/mountain lions/coyotes, wolves, bears

Role in Story

They help find stuff. Pretty much honest brokers, they only deal with the KEG and other thieves guilds when absolutely necessary.

Part mystical -- they help "find" ancient knowledge and cures.  Part detective -- they work with various networks to solve problems arising from robbery, murder and so on.  Part political/archaeological -- they help to return and re-connect lost, stolen, separated property and sentients.

They think of themselves as "weavers" who help to tie Saskan society back together. 

Made up of automous small companies and even individuals, including song-catchers and anthropologists like Ramona'aarql.

The Planet

Role in Story

Many characters are unaware of planetary geometry. The study of astronomy is discouraged by the Heliocastronic authorities. 
Related Characters


Season

Rotation and axial tilt of Gavor are very similar to Earth's.
The distance to Fatune is slightly farther than Earth-Sol. There are exactly 372 days in a solar year. 
Prior to the Catastrophe, Gavor had a somewhat colder climate than Earth and the effects of global warming/climate change were slightly different for this reason.
Unique Features


Description

3rd planet from the Sun. Similar to Earth in many ways. Larger world-ocean. High UV radiation and deteriorated atmosphere in many areas. Ice caps have melted.  Full Moons.

The term "Gavor" refers specifically the land masses of the planet. The world-ocean is called "Havorra". The proper name for the planet is "Gavor and Havorra".

Lurabar is the continent where Saskantinon is located. The Enclosure includes the Saskan Lands, Aranzen, Wesshewen, the Krunkinotto, the Ilyushan Mountains, The Forgh and much of the Krbsh Sea, and the Remari Islands.  The Shanowan Lands are on the East Coast and eastern islands of Lurabar. Shanowa (will likely rename that... I think it is from another book series?) is vaguely known by the Saskan folk because a few rare travelers claim to be from there. (See Luvcando the Shanowan). 

The other very large continent -- unknown to most -- is Bricot, to the south. It is largely a wasteland. 

Rikondo covers the south pole. Was covered in ice for millenia and uninhabitable except for a few hearty species.  Now that is changing.

Pentacross is a medium-sized continent to the east of Lurabar. It was the scene of intense devastation during the Catastrophe but is rich in ruins and some artifacts. 

Greenstrand is another medium-sized continent, to the east of Pentacross. Did not suffer as much in the Catastrophe but had been largely abandoned by huum due to its desolate climate and geography.  Lots of animal life and rich flora have evolved there.

The Firelands, a group of very large islands west of Lurabar, as well as the western shores of Lurabar, host a reviving civilization similar to Saskantinon, but they are little known.  Travel over the Krunkinotto and other large mountain ranges is very difficult. This keeps the areas separated. Unlike the Saskan Lands, areas outside of the Enclosure evolved without interference form the Agency.  

Other lands centered on large islands are: 
	•	Mudhoek, west of Bricot
	•	Bir, in the far north, north of Pentacross
	•	Asterhorn, an island group east of Bricot
	•	The un-naamed island group between Pentacross and Greenstrand

The world ocean is called Havorra. It is commonly referred to as a single entity, though localized bodies are water are referred to as named Seas (the Krbsh Sea and so on). It is widely understood that Havorra encompasses all of Gavor (the name of the planet).  Though different groups have different understandings of geography -- few understand astro-physics correctly; many are unaware of the other continents; and so on.

            <Text>NOVEL FORMAT

Mac vs. Windows Scrivener
The Mac version is much nicer and gets alot more updates from the folks who make Scrivener. Their version numbering is a little confusing. The Mac and Win versions are not directly compatible, but if you EXPORT from the Mac version to “Scrivener 2 format” then you can open the project in the Win version.  To re-open it in the Mac version after editing in Win version, I think you have to import it, but might be able to open it directly. 

There is also a Linux version that is similar to the Win version. Same thing applies. Can open the (Mac) “Scrivener 2 format” projects. It uses qt4, so there is a little bit of config that can be done from qtconfig. (See: https://www.wayoflinux.com/blog/scrivener-returns)

Note to self:  I save my “Ball of Wax” manuscripts under..
~/dropbox/projects/BoW/bow-story  and occasionally do a git commit from there so they end up on GitHub (bow-story/master) too. Check Settings in Scrivener itself to see where Backups get saved… it defaults to a local directory.

About This Template
By default, when compiled (File &gt; Compile), this project will generate a document in the standard manuscript format for novels. Settings are also provided to make it easy to compile to a paperback-style PDF for self-publishing or an EPUB or Kindle ebook.

How To Use This Template
	•	Inside the “Manuscript” folder, create a new folder for each part of your novel as direct subdocuments of the Manuscript folder. Two  folders have already been created at this level for you, with the placeholder title “Part”. You should rename these with the titles of the parts of your novel.
	⁃	Note: The “Manuscript” folder is what we refer to in the documentation as the “Draft folder”. It’s just been renamed “Manuscript” in this template.
	•	Create a new folder for each chapter inside the relevant “Part” folder and title each folder with the name of the chapter. If you don’t intend to use chapter names, just use something descriptive that tells you what the chapter is about. (You do not need to—and indeed shouldn’t—title the folders “Chapter One” and so on, because chapter numbering will be taken care of automatically during the Compile process.) The first chapter folder has been created for you with the placeholder title “Chapter”.
	•	Create a new text document for each scene inside the chapter folders. (Upon export, scenes will be separated with the “#” character for standard manuscript format, or with a blank line for other formats.)
	•	Information about characters can be placed in the “Characters” folder, and information about locations can be placed in the “Places” folder. (These are just regular folders that have had custom icons assigned to them using the Documents &gt; Change Icon feature.)
	•	Character and setting sketch sheets have been provided which can be used for filling out information about the people and places in your novel. These are located in the “Template Sheets” folder.
	⁃	You should not edit the documents in the “Template Sheets” folder directly unless you wish to change the templates (which you are free to do—you may wish to customise the sketch sheets or get rid of them entirely).
	⁃	To create a new character sheet, click on the Characters folder (or wherever you want to create your new character sheet) and from the Project menu, select New From Template &gt; Character Sketch. This creates a new character sketch document for you to edit and fill in with your character details. You can create setting sketch sheets in the same way.
	⁃	Alternatively, you can just click “Add”, or hit cmd-N, with the Characters or Places folders selected.
	⁃	You can view character and setting sketches in the Inspector as follows:
	1.	Select the “Bookmarks” pane in the Inspector.
	2.	If necessary, click on “Document Bookmarks” at the top and switch to “Project Bookmarks”.
	3.	Click on the chevron next to the “Characters” or “Places” folders in the Bookmarks list and choose the sheet you wish to view. (Note that only folders with content show chevrons.)
	•	A “Notes” folder has been provided for project-level notes. This has been set as the default Bookmarks folder in Project &gt; Project Settings, so that when you create a new document from the Bookmarks sidebar in a Quick Reference panel, the document will be added to this folder.

Compiling
	•	Title pages and front matter are all provided in the “Front Matter” folder (between the “Places” and “Notes” folders). Different front matter is used for different formats.
	•	Tip: You can open this document in a Quick Reference panel and have it open alongside the Compile panel if you need to refer to these instructions while compiling.

	•	To compile to standard manuscript format:
	◦	Edit the “Title Page” document inside the Front Matter/Manuscript Format folder to ensure that it contains the correct information (by default it will use information from Contacts).
	◦	Go to File &gt; Compile…
	◦	Next to “Compile for”, select “Print”, “PDF” or one of the rich text file formats such as RTF, Word or OpenOffice.
	◦	Select either “Manuscript (Courier)” or “Manuscript (Times)” from the list of formats on the left (note that this list changes depending on the file format you chosen).
	◦	Ensure that the “Add front matter” button is ticked under the contents list on the right and that the “Manuscript Format” folder is selected in the pop-up button next to it. (This has already been set up for you.)
	◦	Click on “Compile”.

	•	To compile to paperback PDF format:
	◦	Edit the front matter pages contained inside the Front Matter/Paperback folder.
	◦	Go to File &gt; Compile…
	◦	Next to “Compile for”, select “PDF”.
	◦	Select “Paperback (5.06” x 7.81”)” from the list of formats on the left.
	◦	Ensure that the “Add front matter” button is ticked under the contents list on the right and that the “Paperback” folder is selected in the pop-up button next to it if it. (This has already been set up for you.)
	◦	Click on “Compile”.

	•	To compile to ebook format:
	◦	Edit or remove the dedication page contained inside the Front Matter/Ebook folder. Feel free to add any other front matter documents as required.
	◦	Import a cover image (preferably in JPG or PNG format).
	⁃	You can store this anywhere, but it makes sense to place it in the “Ebook” front matter folder. A placeholder cover image is already provided—you will want to delete that once you have imported your own.
	⁃	Be sure to check online for recommended image sizes, because the recommendations are constantly changing. The sample cover image provided is 2,500 x 1,563 pixels, based on Amazon’s recommended size and proportions for a Kindle cover at the time this template was created.
	◦	Go to File &gt; Compile…
	◦	From the “Compile for” menu, select one of the ebook formats.
	⁃	To create an ePub file, choose the “ePub 3” format.
	⁃	To create a Kindle file, choose the “Kindle KF8/Mobi” format.
	⁃	“ePub 2” and “Kindle Mobi” are older versions of the formats. They are mainly provided for supporting projects created in older versions of Scrivener.
	◦	Select “Ebook” from the list of formats on the left.
	◦	If you have front matter documents other than the cover image, ensure that the “Add front matter” button is ticked under the contents list on the right and that the “Ebook” folder is selected in the pop-up button next to it. If you don’t have any front matter documents, you can un-tick “Add front matter”. (Un-ticking this does not affect the cover image.)
	◦	Above the contents list in the rightmost header bar are six buttons. Click on each of them in turn to go through the various available settings, changing what you need. In particular:
	⁃	Fill in the metadata such as author name and book title.
	⁃	Ensure your cover image is selected and shown.
	◦	Click on “Compile”.

Making Changes
There are various minor changes you can make to tweak this template so that it better suits your needs, as follows:
	•	Project and author name: The default book title and author name used in headers and elsewhere can be edited in the metadata pane of Compile (click the tag icon in the rightmost header bar of the Compile panel).
	•	Chapter subtitles: By default, Compile for this template is set up so that chapter numbers are added but not chapter titles. If you want to include the title of the chapter folder in Compile:
	1.	Click on “Assign Section Layouts” at the bottom of the Compile panel.
	2.	Select “Chapter Heading” in the list on the left.
	3.	Select a different layout on the right, such as “Chapter Title”. (These layouts determine how each part of your manuscript looks in the compiled text.)
	•	Part titles: Likewise, by default part numbers are added but not their titles. To include the title of a part:
	1.	Click on “Assign Section Layouts” at the bottom of the Compile panel.
	2.	Select “Part Heading” in the list on the left.
	3.	Select a different layout on the right, such as “Part Title” or “Part Title Page”.
	•	Font: You can override the font used throughout a compiled document:
	1.	At the top of the “Section Layouts” pane in the centre of the Compile panel, change the “Font” setting.
	2.	Note that fonts are not included in ebooks, however—e-readers choose their own fonts (and you would need to pay a hefty fee for a licence to embed a font in an ebook). The “Font” setting is therefore not available for ebook formats.
	•	Page size: The “Paperback” format is set to create a PDF with a page size of 5.06” x 7.81”, which is one of the formats you can use with Amazon’s CreateSpace and is a popular size for trade paperbacks. You can create your own paperback format using a different page size as follows:
	1.	Ctrl-click on the “Paperback (5.06” x 7.81)” format in Compile’s “Formats” list.
	2.	Select “Duplicate &amp; Edit Format…”. The window will change size and content.
	3.	In the “Format Name” text field at the top, change the name to something meaningful (e.g. “Paperback (6” x 9”)”).
	4.	Select “Page Settings” in the sidebar.
	5.	Click on the “Page Setup…” button.
	6.	In the “Page Setup” panel that appears, select “Manage Custom Sizes…” from the “Paper Size” pop-up button.
	7.	Click the “+” button to add a new custom size and give it a name.
	8.	Enter the paper width and height. (Note this is Apple’s standard Page Setup panel, and the units it displays are determined in System Preferences under “Language &amp; Region” &gt; “Advanced…”.)
	9.	Click “OK” and then click “OK” again.
	10.	Click “Save” in the Compile panel. This will return you to the main Compile preview. You now have a variation of the paperback format using a different page size that you can use at any time with any project.
	•	Making your own special folders: The “Characters” and “Places” folders are just regular folders that have been set up in a particular way; you can create other folders that work in a similar manner.
	1.	To create a folder with a custom icon, add a new folder, place it where you want it, ensure it is selected, and then go to Documents &gt; Change Icon to choose a different icon.
	2.	To create your own template sheets, create a new document inside the “Template Sheets” folder and set it up however you want (e.g. add text, change the title or icon, set default metadata and so on). Now this document will be available as the basis for creating new documents from the New From Template menu.
	3.	To make it so that adding a new document to the folder created in (1) always results in a document based on the template set up in (2), select the folder and go to Documents &gt; Default Template for Subdocuments, then choose the template document you created.
	•	Working with chapters instead of scenes: By default, this project is set up so that you write each scene as a separate text document. If you don’t like to break things up quite that much and would prefer to write an entire chapter in each text document, make the following changes:
	1.	Rename the “Scene” documents to use your chapter titles and move them so that they are on the same level as the “Chapter” folder rather than being inside it.
	2.	Move the “Chapter” folders to the Trash. You should now just have a “Part” folder with your chapter text documents inside it.
	3.	Create a new text document for each chapter.
	4.	Go to Project &gt; Project Settings and select “Section Types”.
	5.	Select the “Default Types by Structure” tab.
	6.	Delete “Level 3 files and deeper”.
	7.	In the “Section Type” column, change the setting for “Level 2 files and deeper” to “Chapter”, then hit “OK”. This tells Scrivener that all your files contain chapter text, not scenes. Compile has already been set up to apply the right formatting to the section types defined here.
	•	Using a custom table of contents in ebooks: When exporting to ebook format, Scrivener automatically generates a table of contents. If you would like to customise what appears in the contents, follow these instructions:
	1.	Create a document for your table of contents inside the Front Matter/Ebook folder.
	2.	Name the document “Contents”.
	3.	In the binder, select the documents you would like to appear in the table of contents (hold down Command to select more than one document).
	4.	For a simple flat list, hit Cmd-C or use Edit &gt; Copy. Alternatively, if you would like the table of contents indented to match the binder structure, go to Edit &gt; Copy Special &gt; Copy Documents as Structured Link List.
	5.	Click into the text of the “Contents” document and hit Cmd-V or use Edit &gt; Paste. The documents you wish to appear in the table of contents will now appear as a list of links.
	6.	If you intend to export to an older ebook format (ePub 2 or non-KF8 Mobi), select all of the text and change it to use a 12-point font.
	7.	If you wish to centre the table of contents, select the text and centre it.
	8.	In the Inspector, change the “Section Type” of the “Contents” document to “Table of Contents”. Now, when you Compile, your custom “Contents” document will be used instead of the automatically-generated one. The titles in the links of the “Contents” document will automatically be updated to match those of the final compiled ebook.

Sample Documents
The “Sample Output” folder inside the Research folder contains examples of documents that have been created by compiling from this template. “Standard Manuscript” shows the results when compiling to “Manuscript (Courier)”, and “Paperback Novel” shows the results when compiling to “Paperback (5.06” x 7.81”)” format.

Final Note
Scrivener project templates are flexible and are not intended to restrict you to a particular workflow. You can change, delete or move the files and folders contained in the template to suit how you work.

Like all templates in Scrivener, this project was originally created from the “Blank” template. We’ve simply added a few folders and set everything up in ways that should be useful to novel writers. Everything you can do with this project, you could equally do by creating a “Blank” project and setting it up yourself.

You can create your own templates by setting up a skeletal project with the files, folders and settings you would like to use for new projects and using File &gt; Save As Template.</Text>

            <Title>Iohane</Title>
            <Text>Iohane
27 • Borded

Role in Story
Iohane seeks to bring harmony to the Ring.  Her attitude is an insight into the life of a Ring Rider. She is a knight. A warrior.  And even a little bit of a true princess. 

Iohane and Henqu die in the Gleaming. They are martyrs. Their suffering unleashes great changes throughout the Lands.

Don’t want to steal too much from Game of Thrones. But killing a 'King' more or less during the Fade In certainly gets the audience’s attention! Using a successful plot twist in a new way is Hollywood-standard.
In this case, set up the audience to think I and H are going to be our heros, but then kill them off, shocking everyone. That helps to reveal that our real hero is SPQ and his cohorts. 

I need to figure out how, where SPQ is on trial, for what heresy. Showan and the Byenung community work on his legal defense.

He is not on trial initially for condemning the killing of Iohane and Henqu, but their death intensifies the case against and for SPQ. 
 
Goal
To hear the silence of a falling star lighting up a purple sky. To show the way. To tie together the old traditions and the new path.
Physical Description
Lanky but physically strong. Female/hetero, un-partnered but in love with Henqu. Like all Ring Riders, outward appearance, presentation is gender neutral but not obsessively so. Usually seen only well-armored and armed. 

Personality
Outspoken in a straightforward likable way. Good at intervening in dicey situations before they get out of hand, using her words to calm down conflicts.  Strong as an ox and twice as deadly when needed.
Sometimes called a weir witch by certain Heliops due to her knowledge of the western lands, but she is not related to any Weir Lands tribes nor is she affiliated with the Empafarasi.

Occupation
Ring Rider.

Habits/Mannerisms
Always correct, as befits a Ring Rider, but willing to crack a joke to ease tensions, or to make a slightly racy or caustic remark in order to get folks’ attention. 

Background
From a hardscrabble farming village in the Norgyte. Most of her clan are battle-hardened, having defended their farms many times from entropic raiders coming down from the Wesshewen plains.  Recruited into the Fatune Tagabant in Mixry after serving a time with the Volunteers, Iohane chose to abandon the Heliop barracks, voluntarily went to Borded when she was 21 to offer her sword to the Riders Council.  

This happened after a chance encounter with a Ring Rider named Henqu, who impressed her immensely, not least of all with his song.  And after meeting Ramona, who opened her heart to the Terrapina, to the river-soul.

Internal Conflicts
Prone to seeing the best in all the traditions and over-looking the worst, Iohane is a natural advocate for unity between beklek and bexik, between Heliops, Kahila, Settan, Arnazen and so on. She has a vast vision of post-Catastrophical unity that even encompasses the entropic tribes and the faraway lands of Shanowa and Ayshewen. The threats posed by the monsters of the Ilyushan Mountains, the mysteries of the Forgh and the Komikol, and the dire possibilities of Re-emergence posed by the Bugs, or whatever they are, in the Krunkinotto, give her pause. She worries that only an apocalyptic conflict with such forces can remove the threat they pose, but she believes there is a higher power that will come the aid of the sentients.

External Conflicts
All the usual problems of being a cop on the Ring, plus some continuing meanness and vulgarity from former comrades in Mixry and the surrounding parts of the Ring where efforts were made to tarnish her reputation after she joined the Riders.

Card Number: 40
+ / -  Main conflicts in this scene.

The Agency announces a reorg. (How? Who does so? What does it actually say?)

Many embedded Agents (who?) exit the surface from Nyeland. How? Teleportation? Ships? 

Some (who?) begin to move on to other assignments (such as?). 

The ASS (no, not that) Visitor prepares shuttles to take agents to the opening of a space-time-portal. (OK... But also ho-hum? Can we have our super-extra-terrestials do something fun here.)  

Azron  (who we need to see more of, perhaps he is our primary story-teller?) chooses to stay on Gavor. 

Monmar Massachawa decides to leave. (Have we clearly identified that she is an Agent?) She gifts some interesting toys for the Empafarasi to play with (oh? Such as? What youths?). Needs to say goodbye to Stan, Ramona and Mikel. She should invite B'arqo to go with her, but he will decline.
&gt; &lt;  Main events, resolutions, actions in this scene.

As they prepare for the next project, mid-level Agency managers continue to squabble over what works and what doesn't, the problem with bosses, the problem with difficult employees who don't follow policy and so on.

With the departure of Vice-Regent Bud Starga, the mandate of heaven has, literally, shifted. Neither the Lohrnites, nor the folks around Giltraq, nor the new Reformed Center of the Heliopsis have a strong ally from the Agency.  While She Who Ferries Across the Stars clearly showed that she favored the work being initiated by Stanley (and others), she does not stick around to manage anything. 

A skeleton crew of Agents is left as observers, but they no longer have a clear mandate themselves. In effect, the Enclosure is lifted. What we have in their place are a few emerging "Earthly Immortals" and candidates to such status, like Malborra, Petra, Rollo, Sáamal Wititiri, Waleran, B'arqo, Stanley, Ramona and Birakay, who may have the potential to be recruited as "Spiritual Immortals", that is, recruited into the Agency.

Finish --&gt;  One of the characters  introduced to Giltraq is Ramona in disguise. Has she left the Sisters and is on a trail of revenge? Is she seeking to influence Giltraq in a fresh direction?

 Timeline

During the 6 months after Card 38.
Beauty

The interweaving of sand and water in a long, low tidal basin during low tide, almost all the way out to the horizon, before the edge of the ocean can be detected, on a misty day, when the boundary between sky and sea is also indistinct.
Humor

In a kind of reflection very much "from below" of the shift, let's have a parade or demonstration or celebration of the Afflicted take place in which everybody wears a mask or a costume of some kind. Actively obfuscate the distinction between fed/unfed, huum/sint, young/old and so on. And do so without any explanation.  
Truth

“Our awareness is all that is alive and maybe sacred in any of us. Everything else about us is dead machinery.” – Kurt Vonnegut, Breakfast of Champions

Impact

An echoing and reflection ("as above, so below") of the feelings in Card 39.

            <Text>As the Great Auction of Selaron gets underway, Birakay — a hunk —  performs.  We meet other young heroes and get a closer look at Showan Nywing. 

Lots of strange and strangely beautiful characters — including some we’ve already met — mill about, participating in the auction. This is a chance to introduce all or most of our remaining main characters.

SPQ, though his role has not been central except in the first chapter, is our main hero. 


Showan is the hero's tragic friend. He puts many pieces of our mystery together and, being a tragic hero, will lose out in the love triangle of SPQ —&gt; Birakay —&gt; Showan —&gt; SPQ. And may lose his life as well. Not sure about that yet. 


This chapter elevates.

Rise, rise.  A dance takes place.  Love interests emerge.  There is buying, selling, exhibits, shows, entertainments, mad intrigue.  

And a small fall, when the freedom of the Mobalbesq is challenged directly by both Rider and Heliop authorities, both of whom interfere with the auction on behalf of the developing war effort, making mobilization calls for the Tagabant and announcing increased security measures (Riders).

- "Act Summary" notes are attempts at a précis of a large section of the story.
- "Cards" are very brief markers intended to re-arranged as needed, and fitting into a typical screenplay layout. Should be at least one or more cards within each chapter.
- Tentative "Chapters", titled, numbered and organized as folders within the "Acts"

            <Title>Ch 5 - Summary</Title>
            <Text>Holidays Among the Kahilafolk


This chapter picks up real-time narration. (Who is telling this part of the story? I think we are reading Bu'ruq's journal at this point. Who acquired it?  Was it an Agent? Azron?)

Following the trail of wee swashbuckler Kirill Gecker, proprietor of the Full Moons, takes us to encounters with romperi and bitamin and the rich, complex quilt of Kahila culture, in sharp opposition to the symbolic order presented in the initial chapters.


Bu’ruq breaks the rules.

A darker side of things begins to emerge in more detail as the mis-adventures of Mur’ray provide an inroad into getting to know the ways of the bitamin and romperi.



Another view of the world beyond the Lands of the Two Rivers emerges — the shippers, the boat-people, the sea-folk of Mobalbesq — who laugh, albeit somewhat nervously, at the idea of an Enclosure. 

More details emerge about the Southlands, their large sint populations, the other partner/prey of the Kahilafolk. 

Get a closer look at the opposing but inter-related realities of the Outer Lands — the industrious and contentious Byerunics, the the fiercely independent tribes of the Nye Lands and Arq.

            <Title>The Night Hall</Title>
            <Text>The Night Hall
Type • Main Locations

Role in Story

A high-level syndicate tied mainly to the leading families of the Runes of Bye, Mobalbesq and the Nye Lands as well as representatives from Arq and Kahilakol. Something like a Riders Council and Riders Union for the non-Fatunik parts of The Outer Lands, but with a less highly structured framework.

The Night Hall helps to coordinate business dealings, in the manner of the Riders Union, among the people of the 5 provinces especially, and among the affiliated guilds. And it serves as a clearinghouse for communications and politics within the region.

It plays an important role in coordination of fishing and sea-creature-exploitation expeditions, as something of a trusted broker, bank or insurer in many deals, especially via the innocuously-named "Cooks" and "Tailors" guilds, and a protector of those who work as mages, astronomers, harpers and bards. The latter network, combined with the Poteen Spirit Makers and Distributor, which supplies all sort of s'lah and other beverages to inns throughout the lands, gives the Night Hall eyes and ears in many Toons, much like the FHC does for the Riders, but with considerably more obscured branding and with a more extensive network in the Southern Lands, where most of the ingredients for s'lah are harvested and fermented.

The Night Hall is sometimes accused of being a fence for various Kahila-protected thieves guilds, but I couldn't possibly comment on that.
Relationship to Other Organizations

Guilds loosely affiliated with The Night Hall include:
	•	Mages Guild
	•	Saskan Shores Sailors and Sea-Farers 
	•	Canal Workers Union
	•	Saskantinon Tailors Guild
	•	Cooks of the Great Lake of Bye
	•	Harpers and Bards of the Two Rivers
	•	Poteen Spirit Makers and Distributors
	•	Engineers for the Saskan Folks
	•	Kahila Cuisinary Artists Guild
Description

The Night Hall is both a building -- located in Byenung -- and the council of leaders from the lands and organizations of the Outer Lands (Arq, Runes of Bye, Mobalbesq, Nye Lands).  

It is not unusual for representative or observers from the Krbsh Sea (Krbshana) to attend. The Night Hall building is located right on the Great Lake of Bye and the Hall itself includes two submerged, watery sections, one with fresh water and one with salt water.  Unbeknownst to all but a few, there are occasional representatives from the Remari Islands as well, but the very existence of those islands -- much less the fact of contact with sints and huum from outside of the Enclosure, is a closely-guarded secret.   

From time to time, depending on the topic under discussion -- observers, guests and representatives from other provinces are invited to attend meetings of the Night Hall.
Roles of Members

The Night Hall helps to manage problem, issues between the provinces of the Outer Lands, and between the Outer Lands and other provinces, mainly the Fatunik Authority, to which all of the Outer Land theoretically pay homage, and to the Rider Council in Borded. There are occasional issues with Kahilakol and Kahilabeq as well.

A main goal of the Night Hall is to provide, institutionally, for a certain degree of autonomy from the Fatunik Authority. All of the provinces of the Outer Lands maintain a mythology of origin that predates the arrival of the Fatunik and Rider Migration. They all claim to have either lived in the Saskan Lands since time immemorial, or to have arrived before the others.

            <Text>The Event in Ríkila

Present this a fairly recent past. Or at least tell it later in the story, not presented in real time.  Not quite sure how to fully expound on it.  If this mess is a success, maybe I can come back to it in prequel.

In any case, I need to have a clear understanding of it for my own background purposes. 

Pretty much my most popular Gamma World scenario regarding the uprising in Brokiki.  

It should be reflected retro-actively by showing Ríkila as the only ring town who's walls are permanently breached -- where the Empafarisan forces smashed them down when they came to put an end to the uprising, restore order, and create the divided rule that characterizes the town when the story opens.

Also I like referring to the Event in a Badiouian way and hope to get geek mileage out of it by incorporating some of Badiou's terminology into Saskan philosophical and political debate and discourse. 

Use this as a trigger for themes on the possibilities for transformative change.

Age • Location

Role in Story
Interest, background

Goal


Physical Description
One of the few highly-sentient mixed-with-huum actors with a distinctly non-huum appearance.  Sleeths are reptilian -- a joke on the whole reptile aliens from .. whatever thing.  Except in this case, they are actually descended from those alien-reptilian predecessors who arrived from a star system in the direction of Draco long, long, long ago. 

But are not evil or dangerous at all. Just the opposite. 

They look very much like huge lizards, but with hands, feet, semi-huum-looking heads.

They have a very distinctive Bar dialect -- Sleebar -- that is difficult for most Sogomsh and Eibar speakers to grasp, yet is not an Eibarq or Arqq variety. 
Personality
Unlike their ancestors, tho, and despite their bizarre appearance, Sleeths are pacifist, pastoral, anarchic in their approach to governance. They are the Jains -- or at least the Sikhs -- of the Saskan Lands


Occupation


Habits/Mannerisms
The Amish of the Saskan countryside. Do not embrace modern tools, ideologies or conflicts. Shy, insular, introverted, seek to avoid contact with huum and huum-appearing sentients.

Background


Internal Conflicts
Concerns about sins of the fathers.   Sleeth children are taught to never mix with huum and to never, never try to pretend they are huum.   They blame their ancestors for many of the worst atrocities in huum history, possibly for the Catastrophe itself.

External Conflicts
Considered unclean by many Heliops, the Sleeth clans are subject to cruel treatment by the more extreme elements of the Tagabant. Even Rider-affiliated and Eelani huum tend to recoil the first time they encounter Sleeths, thinking they are dangerous like Arns or Jacks.

Type of Location
A Fatunik military encampment located in the northern woods of Tabloonque, Fatuneigol is the ideological training center for the Fatunik Volunteers. Presented as something like a summer camp for Fatunik youth, it provides ideological reinforcement as much as military training.

The place where many young Heliops learn the songs they sing the rest of their lives. 

Its placement not too far from the border with Juukol makes it a convenient remedy for those who traveling to and from Juuj looking for the old, traditional, authentic Fatunik spirit.  Fatuneigol offers a lively, very much Beshquan-style Fatunik modernity and certainty as antidote to the mysteries and vagaries of the old ways.

            <Text>These are groups of sentient being who are very distinctly neither huum nor bek. That is, they have little or no, or at least very little, in common with huum genotypes.

They are not necessarily rebels. Nor do they necessarily seek conflict with huum and sint Saskan communities. 

The Jaxen are a special case. There are Jaxen who -- much like the Servants of Cereb -- seek to replace huum-bek authority altogether. But there are also Jaxen who seek accomodation and integration with organic life forms.

Some of these groups, like the Devosh, live quietly, almost invisibly, amongst the huum and sint, appearing occasionally in a show of solidarity against outside threats.

            <Text>Roís
20 seasons • Traveler/Refugee

Role in Story
A side-kick to the M3 network. Roís helps them to gather together travelers and refugees from the western lands.  He tells about the depredations of the machinic Jaxen who control the Krunkinotto, providing a window into rural life in the western hills.
Goal
He tells the story of refugees in a way that brings a sense of compassion and equanimity to the grander tale. Roís seeks to develop a sense of caring/kindness in his listeners, even though he is not terribly easy to get along with or even to sympathize with. 

Physical Description
Lithe, hungry. Can be mean. Hates the Jaxen with a passion.

Personality
Angry, despises the Jaxen. Not at all sympathetic to other technologically enhanced beings and apparatuses.  Has never had much to do with modified or enhanced or mixed sentients.  Tends to view all non-huum as possible source of food.

Occupation
Hunting, trapping, fishing.

Habits/Mannerisms
Speaks only Eibar. Comrades in the circles are teaching him some Eibarq words.

Background
Refugee from a well-to-do rural / peasant mountain village in the mountains of western Oknott province. Family and most of the village was wiped out in a raid. Roís is the only survivor.  

Internal Conflicts
Bitter, angry about the destruction of his family and home. Neither the Riders nor the Volunteers protected them. His prejudices against non-huum are challenged via his friendship/alliance with the M3 network, who are open to all sints and all sentient animals. His anger is due in part to the fact that Roís’s behavior back in the village was not exemplary and may have played a role in revealing the location of their village to the Jaxen.

External Conflicts

            <Text>The End of Ilyushan
Card Number: 37
+ / -  Main conflicts in this scene.

[Probably need a chapter or section or two prior to this that shows the Ilyushan advance more clearly, along with more insight into the Ilyushan themselves. See bio on Calley Coola.]

The Ilyushan suffer terrible losses once the united Volunteer, Rider, Resistance and western forces counter-attack. They retreat back to the East, into the mountains and swamps.

Calley Coola and Mu'ray go with them, having made a copy of the New Song and stolen some of SPQ's notebooks. [OK. Need to show the stealing part. And need to have shown the relationship between Mu'ray and Calley Coola (who needs a better name). 

The main conflict here is a massively epic battle scene. Rider Cavalry charges. Volunteers fighting like Roman legions. Resistance militias making surprise attacks and fighting like wild banshees.  Byenung and a few DV types showing some interesting martial arts skills. The Untamed showing proficiency with projectiles of various kinds and carefully targeted tracking, flanking and mass attacks (show some of their history with wolves and coyotes, far removed from huum eyes).  To everyone's astonishment, Empa/Eelani airships -- in their steampunk glory -- arrive, dropping fighters behind enemy lines and fireballs on the enemy positions.

In the midst of all that, show the Ilyushan carrying away their dead and mourning. 

Having been relieved by the Green Lady Who Travels Among the Stars, Vice Regent Bud Starga packs up his starship and leaves, taking a group of Agents with him, on to their next assignment, another watery planet, on the other side of the galaxy, that is experiencing ecological collapse, social convulsions and is expected to stupidly blast itself with nukes any time now.

Giltraq is hailed by Heliops as the savior of Ingar.
&gt; &lt;  Main events, resolutions, actions in this scene.

CC reminds others that even demons condemned to hells can find enlightenment -- just might take them a bit longer.


Finish --&gt;  The rain and thunder make the fighting messy and confusing. There are literally rivers of blood and gore. As the Ilyushan begin to retreat in the face of the aerial bombardments, the Sun comes out -- a contradictory moment of celebration for the Fatuniks since the first thing they see in the bright sky are the Empafarasi airships.

 Timeline

Continue directly from Cards 36. (With continuity regarding Calley Coola and Mur'ray tied together)  Need to make sure the dramatic appearance of the airships in the east has already occurred. Report on sightings of their progress, the fear it inspires among the Lorhnites, the reaction among others.
Beauty

Work through the five phases and their interactions when describing the great battle. The circling earth motion as the forces converge in spirals, the internalizing metal-forging of spirit as battle is joined, the sinking and absorbing of blood and water and feelings, the expansion in every direction of courage and coordination, the rocket-like firing of energy high into the heavens. From the desert-like emptiness of devastation, to the clash of weapons that stirs the hearts of warriors, to the waters that wash it all away, to the new shoots of the great trees, to the Sun itself, and around. And around. From emptiness, fullness.  From fullness, emptiness. Snek takes it all in.
Humor

SeeAct V, Scene II, lines 30-40, 180-210 of Shakespeare's "Love's Labor's Lost". Do some fun patter having to do with numbers, traveling -- with trumpets and music -- as Birakay and SPQ are reunited.
Truth

Even demons condemned to various hells can find enlightenment over time.  And while Earth Immortals can achieve great longevity, they are not yet becoming Spirit Immortals. 

Impact

A great outpouring of yang energy.

            <Title>Ch 3 - Summary</Title>
            <Text>This chapter portrays Birakay's radical new Song.   Birakay's "Rich Tall Tales of Iohane and Henqu"  gets him and them into trouble.  It provides a tour of the Ring, including a picture of the devastating impact that lack of pollinators has had. 

An easy-going motif of fall, rise, fall as we hear the rich tall tales and songs of the northern and eastern parts of the Ring get to know 
		the Riders, 
		the Heliops, 
		the ancient history of the Saskan Lands, 
		about the borderlands to the north and east, 
		the Kahilafolk, 
		and the Outer Lands. 

Iohane and Henqu are heroic.  Can you guess which is the likable fool and which the tempted love interest?


Borded and its the Riders are featured in a song sung by a Fatunik legend. While learning something of the history of the Lands, it is apparent that there has been "a disturbance in the force"..  

The Riders Guild and the famed town of Borded gallop into the forefront of our consciousness, with its heroic role as defenders and protectors of the Saskan Lands, through the tale of Iohane and Henqu. We meet other Riders, we engage with caravans, we learn about the agricultures along and within the Rivers. We glimpse the immense suffering of the Afflicted and the immense challenges facing the Lands. 


Starting out in rich, wealthy and vibrant Borded, the song takes us to Jivákala, which foreshadows a detour in the story-telling.  This first look at Heliops country, its legendary history, its mythic traditions generates a sinking feeling. Sinking in the yin sense -- this is home, this is familiar, this is safe. Sinking in the existential sense -- this is flawed, this is temporary, this is dangerous. 
The song visits the prisoner-workers of aptly-named Mixry, where we see the front lines with Wesshewen barbarism. A sense of the necessity of the Heloptic Tagabants is restored — but the question has been asked, doubts have been raised...


The Tall Tales take us on to Rútonik, into the ancient eastern Saskan lands and closer to the dangerous eastern borders. When Iohane and Henqu ride into Ríkila, the theme of song intersects with B'arqo’s narration.  The sea and the South -- these mysteries are left unsolved.

            <Text>Death of a Candlemaker
Card Number: 18
+ / -  Main conflicts in this scene.

Kaharan wants to work with herbs. Allane wants to escape. They both want to help the Afflicted. Their love is opposed by both families and their work is condemned by the Authority.  Tragedy ensues and they must flee.

&gt; &lt;  Main events, resolutions, actions in this scene.

Kaharan is from the Southlands. Her extended family are close to the Dauni Vakasaqua and are devoted Settans, keeping all of the river rites.  She is close to the soil and has a particular interest in a self-propagating green called the Forgan Weed, native to Aranzen. It has a high nutritional value and tends to improve the soil.  

She often experiences vivid dream-states that sometimes portend real-world events, occasionally she has waking visions too. Eager to help with making improvements to southern agriculture, she becomes frustrated at the slow pace of adopting new ideas. 

On a regular herbalist trade mission into Fatunik territory, traveling from Barbol in the Flowlands to Bordakal in the Borda Woods, she meets, forms a friendship with, and then falls in love with Allane, who has been dreaming of escaping to Harvestun one day.

Both of them normally present a gender-neutral face to the world,  but Allane wants to develop a feminine persona thinking that that will make him more welcome in the Low Weirlands, which are famously matriarchal.  Kaharan agrees to help and in the course of their amusements with that effort, find a shared interest in the possibilities of the Forgan Weed alleviating the suffering of the Afflicted.

Already listed by the Watch as a security risk, Allane's relationship with Kaharan brings increased scrutiny, which eventually leads to the death of a "candlemaker", one of Tonedo's secret agents.  This triggers much of the next wave of events. The death of the candlemaker is mis-represented by Tonedo as a terrorist attack, and he uses it to help initiate a pogrom-like attack on Kahila, Southerners, the Untamed and even some "loyal" elements in the Outer Lands.  Allane is widely condemned as "Public Enemy Number One". 

Finish --&gt;  Kaharan and Allane flee Bordakal in the middle of the night, encountering and being rescued by Petra Bearbek and the legendary Malavorra herself when they emerge on to the Ring Road.

Timeline

Action --&gt; Minor flashback, continuing into the present timeline. The Gleaming and associated events occur some time after Kaharan and Allane hook up in Bordakal.  The final scene intersects with chapter 16.  
Beauty

Romeo and Juliet. The desire to do something good. 
Humor

Joyfully playing around with gender-bending.
Truth

One must pass through multiple gates to reach the inner sanctum.  
Impact

Panic. Mortal danger. Being chased around town. Fleeing Being chased through a dark woods with the sheriff on your trail.

            <Text>B'arqo / B'arqo
60+ • Always on the move

Role in Story
A narrator, a bard, a story-teller and a song-collector by trade. Think in terms of Shakepearean narrator characters, but with more of a sidekick to him

The ironic part is that he’s not sidekick at all. He is in fact quite solitary — un-dog-like, more wolf-like I suppose.

He travels easily through many different kinds of communities, makes friends easily. He knows more about the big picture than most characters.  His typical performances are more reminiscent of, say, Hank Williams or Jimmie Rodgers, than Bob Wills.  

Goes by various names and aliases. Get a fix on what they are.

He will likely be the most important narrator in the overall tale -- though not the only one I think.
Goal
By exploring his back-story, we learn about the geography, languages, communities, stories of the Lands.  By following his travels, we should eventually uncover the story of the Event in Ríkila.  He is something like the private investigator in a noir mystery.
Physical Description
20% canine, noticeable mainly in his hands, only slightly in his face. Hairy. Long but not floppy ears.  A slightly protruded mouth. Sharp teeth (canines). Acute sense of smell.  Dresses in an unassuming Arql country style, mostly in black and grays.  
Personality
Avuncular without being obsequious. Thoughtful and philosophical. 
Occupation
Bard / Song-catcher. Also a member of various Mages guilds which he typically denies. 
Habits/Mannerisms
Likes to drink s’lah but not to excess. Will smoke a pipe if offered, but not habitually. Is a vegetarian for ethical reasons, though often has carnivorous instincts, which he must struggle with. 
Background
He was whelped in Arg, where his parents were refugees from the The Forgh. He had some siblings but doesn’t remember them well. They lived in the wild and on the fringes of villages. He learned to sing and to read at a young age, thanks to a some wandering bards. His father was killed by wild animals.  (He may have been selected for covert training by Agents.) Ran away many times. Often in trouble with the Watches as a youngster. Enslaved for a couple of years, then spent a couple of years at the Beet Farm, where he was often visited by his Mama, who encouraged him to become a Bard and not fall in with the romperi gangs. Upon his release, and after his mother passed away, he started wandering and gathering songs.  He spent several years with a mages collective (influenced by Agent) where he became aware of the true nature of the Event and the Enclosure, and ended up studying philosophy in some depth at the Academy in Terpinol, where he is well-connected. Probably a member of the MHUP. 
Internal Conflicts
Assimilation issues. Doesn’t wholly fit in with either puros or impuros communities. Has sympathy for both.
Philosophical issues. As someone who is aware of the nature of the Event and the Enclosure, he is often pondering contingency/necessity. How free can they be? What is the real nature of language? And so on.
Loneliness. Lack of / loss of family.  Often wonders if he could connect with his lost siblings.
Deep knowledge of speciation makes him a careful observer of puros/impuros psychology and behavior patterns.
Vegetarian with carnivorous instincts.
Is both nerdy and street smart.
External Conflicts
He is considered to be a potential criminal element by the Fatunik authorities, who keep an eye on him.
Animal separatists don’t trust his many connections with puros and Heliop communities.
His knowledge of actual astronomy puts him at odds with both Heliops and some of the more woo star-gazer types.
His knowledge of ancient secrets makes him both loved and feared by various cults.
His knowledge of the Enclosure makes him a person of interest among the Agents.

            <Title>In the Garden - Scene 1</Title>
            <Synopsis>Getting in the door</Synopsis>
            <Text>
An old gray cur slunk into the Inn of the Full Moons, dropping a small handful of trits into the open palm of the off-duty basherbazooki watching the door. 
The basherbazh mumbled a greeting to the old bard: “B'arqo. Been a while. Where ya been riding?”
“Grrrrr... Yer mother’s a bullock. Mind yer own business,” the cloaked sint story teller replied in a barely audible growl. 
The bouncer smirked and stomped a foot hard enough to give the old man a start.  With their sizable musculature, a basherbaz’s formidable leg-ends shod in well-fortified Hádikan combat boots did indeed end in hooves.  Making a joke about it to their face was a way to get one's own foot crushed.
The old traveler sometimes called B'arqo was a well-known joker. 

The old dog thrived in rough places like Ríkila by knowing how to push things up to the limit of decency, or a tad more, just enough to get a rise and often enough glean some info.  Not enough to get a stomping. 
Once inside the Full Moons, B'arqo found the Jax he was looking for.  He took a seat at a long table and turned on his story-teller charm, sharing a free wisdom lesson with the young Lookie.  
The Jax listened carefully, trying to make out words from B'arqo’s thick dialect:   “Listen, Jax, did you hear me teasing that basherbazooki at the door about his gigantic feet?  See ‘em?  Know why he keeps ‘em hidden in those boots?  Because a sint who appears to be fully huum gets better grub and earns higher rank than one with an obvious mix of, say, huum and bos in their family tree. Know what I mean?  That’s why your basherbazh  hides his hooves. See?  Get me?  Now listen. I let him know I know because that gives me some leverage. In case I need a friend. Y’see what I mean?  That’s how you earn leverage. That’s what I’m teaching you today.  For free.” 
B'arqo was aware that, despite their limited mental and verbal capacity, every free Jax wants to improve their understanding.  A Jax is forever trying to separate out in their little piece of the collective Jax mind. Teasing out real knowledge gleaned by lived experience from implanted memories acquired at the Farm can furrow the brow of a Jax in an aha way.  B'arqo knew that.  Seeing Jax furrow his brow was one of the small pleasures that can make a difficult day more bearable. 
The Lookie wrinkled its forehead in concentration. 
A smile swept over the old man’s face as quickly as a Byerunics-crew shoots the rapids of the Upper Pavan on their way back to Byenung.
The Jax stared blankly into the old feller’s eyes with a look that said, “I understood about a tenth of that.”  What they actually said, entirely predictably, was, “Well met! Say, friend, my name’s Jax. Are you planning an adventure?  Do you need some assistance? I understand that you may need a friend, yes? Am I right?”
B'arqo’s countenance resumed its weary road-worn look.

In a mean country like Saskantinon, in its crueler towns like Ríkila, it’s not unusual for folks to take advantage of  Lookalikes.  Telling them lies in order to gain their confidence, to get them to do your bidding.  A typical scam was to take one on as an expendable crew member to do the dangerous work.
He tipped the clone a shan and instructed them to let the proprietor know he’d arrived. 

As he waited, B'arqo let his thoughts wander. He bore a name that’s just a joke to puros, as they liked to call themselves.  The ones who dominated politics within the Ring.  A none-too-kind puro had discovered his canine features and enslaved him as a pet and an unpaid worker.  That was many, many moons ago.  Long before he’d become a song-catcher, and a bard and had gained the reputation of a mage.
He wondered if he’d had a name prior to that. Couldn’t recall. Suspected personal naming was mostly a huum habit anyway.  Considered, as he studied the intricately wrought beams of the bar-room ceiling, that when he visited the extensive warrens of the Alfer strongholds well to the south of the Ring, collecting the new songs made popular by their resistance movement, nearly every rabbit-sint he’d met introduced each other only as my brother, the noble sister, our leading comrade, hero platoon leader and such, with any kind of familiar name, patronym or matronym.
With his long experience of pain and suffering, B'arqo had pity to spare for the moon-spawned, star-born creatures of the night, as Fatunik slander put it.  He didn’t believe the Sun worshipers’ ill-informed explanations for the many variations of life that had emerged since the Event.   
He knew enough about the Land Between Two Rivers, and many of the Lands Beyond, to have some pity for the puro huum too, who, despite their illusions of superiority, also suffered in this life. As far as B'arqo could make out, they met their end as surely and often as swiftly as any other sints.  
Well. Except maybe those tied into the genetic line of terrapins and sea turtles. He suspected them of having inherited something like a gem of immortality from their sea-born ancestors.

It was time to have some fun.
B'arqo threw back his head, cleared his throat, and recited, loudly, in the sing-song way of an experienced bard, while tapping out a beat on the table, some doggerel in Arqq, the forbidden language of the animals, from the age-old Bard Songs of the Jivákala, known and loved by all sints regardless of their station and community.
Practicing the kind of showmanship that earns a bard a nice little pile of shan now and again, he included in his recital some canine sounds that would be interpreted by most Eibar-speakers as dog-sint, or possibly even the sounds of a natural non-sentient dog, expressing some level of disappointment:  that mournful country-yodel that only dogs can do with full justice to the form.  
It was the kind of performance that would get a sint reprimanded by the Fatune Tagabant, or hauled away by the Dorq Tagabant, in a Heliops-controlled town. It was the kind of performance that the patrons of the Full Moons reveled in. It earned him a loud round of cheers.
From the murky depths of the bar room came a chorus of especially growlshy chuckles. Those denizens of the Full Moons who spoke or understood Arqq quickly picked up on his take on the old favorite, joining in on the well-known refrain with a harmony of various animal-toned inflections, “Oh if I had a shan / for every stupid thing a Jax said / I’d be richer than a witcher / in the Firelands!”. 

The Jax had returned to his side during the recital. They told B'arqo, as the chorus wound down, that the proprietor would be with him shortly.
He reached into his small money-pouch, extending small retractable fingers from gloved hands to manipulate the coins once the paw-like protrusion of his palm was out of sight from prying eyes. To a casual observer watching across a smoky bar room, he was just an ordinary old fellow scratching his belly.
At 60-plus solar turns, he was ancient by local standards. B'arqo’s secret to longevity included concealing his 20-some-percent canine mix not only from the Dorq Tagabant, but from anybody else who didn’t have a need to know the extent of his impuros.   
In perfectly fluent Eibar with only a hint of an Eibarq accent, the multilingual and multi-talented bard said, “Jax, my friend.  I would very much like a bowl of s’lah while we wait for Master Kirill. Can you help me with that?  Here’s a ban for the barseff and a shan for your troubles,” he said, deftly passing the small coins along to his front paw and handing them over.  

The Jax beamed with delight as they sauntered over to the bar, to all appearances pleased as punch to be helping with a mission. Returned in a jiffy to hand his new friend a bowl of the ubiquitous drink of the Saskan Lands.</Text>

            <Title>Jaxen</Title>
            <Text>The Jaxen
Indeterminate • many

Role in Story
Some comic relief, but also a mystery.

Goal
To serve. And to spy for the (Created) (aka the Cloned). We will call them the Bugs or Hempties in common tongue. 

Physical Description
Human-like with a limited vocabulary in most cases.

Personality
Follows routine scripts in most cases. Not many realize that they have something of a hive mind.

Occupation
Most of employed as servers at inns, but also found in other menial tasks.
Sometimes employed as “red shirts” on quests/missions.

Habits/Mannerisms
Somewhat obsequious, generally humble. Appear/disappear without notice.

Background
Sent down from the bases of the Created in the Krunkinotto Mountains to infiltrate organic society,
a Jax has a minimalist pre-built memory reflective of the environment they are sent into. 
They are one model of cloned being. Others are considerably more dangerous. The main purpose of a Jax is to collect info and report back to the main nodes. 

Internal Conflicts
Conflicting directions or complex philosophical questions can mess with a Jax’s programming, causing kernel panic and other types of crashes.  Their empathy AI components are the source of numerous fuzzy outcomes; some Jaxen can become very attached to specific organic life-forms.

External Conflicts
Most Jaxen eventually come to realize that they are not huum and this can cause existential crises of various kinds. Generally, the central nodes recall them once their AI reaches this point of complexity. In rare cases, a Jax will resist being recalled; this can lead to a shutdown unit being sent to close them down. Some organic forms have a deep antipathy towards the Created and have no compunction about crashing or (in rare cases) re-programming a Jax.  The Agency is aware of the Jax problem but, along with a reluctance to interfere too much in planetary affairs, has not yet developed a virus or similar malware strong enough to penetrate the Code of the Created.

Notes
The Jaxen hierarchy is fairly large. Specialized varieties exist. But almost all are either huum-like or insect-like. In the Home Caves, Control sometimes takes on the form of giant Spiders or Centipedes. There are quite a few generations, patches and releases. Older versions continue to function for some time in most cases, except when there has been some kind of major system problem. (see Release 4.0, for example)

The manufacturing systems of the Created are called, generically, the System. The command-and-control system which links most Jaxen together is usually called either Control or The Web. 

Releases, upgrades, patches follow standard Unix-style numbering and major release also receive code names relating mostly to Order Hemiptera (”True Bugs”). 

1.x.x  “Water Boatmen”
	○	Jaxen 1.0.0 were mainly designed to infiltrate the waterways, primarily in insect form, with some very rudimentary huum versions, typically very small.
	○	1.2.0, called “Back Swimmers”, took on the shape, in some cases, of small boats

2.x.x  “Water Bugs” or “Belos” and “Light Bugs”
	○	Jaxen 2.0 included submersibles for the first time.
	○	2.3.0, called “Toe Biters” and “Light Bugs”, moved into smaller ponds and marshes, often as bottom-crawlers, where they posed some problems for fisherfolk.  
	○	The “Light Bug” huum variety were attracted to hearths and such, which helped to replenish their energy source.  At this stage, the huum-style Jaxen had almost no verbal skills and were still very short in stature.

3.x.x  “Water Scorpions”
	○	Jaxen 3.0.0 were longer and taller. The huum versions were somewhat more believable, though very skinny. They began to take on simple labor tasks, particular at farms and granaries.
	○	The insect versions developed an offensive capability that allowed them to paralyze victims, usually for the purpose of bringing them back to the System for study.

4.x.x. “Toad Bugs” or “Gellies”
	○	Jaxen 4.0.0 were not very successful and it is rare to find one still extant. First insect variety designed for land travel, they hopped and looked like small toads. 
	○	Humo version was an attempt to fill out the form, but tended to become oddly misshapen and lumpy in a short time.

5.x.x. “Striders”
	○	Jaxen 5.0.0 corrected the flaws in Release 4. More spherical-shaped huum bodies that did not “gel out”. 
	○	Insect versions can skim/surf over water and come in sizes large enough to carry small loads.

6.x.x. “Bed Bugs”
	○	Jaxen 6.0.0 were the first specialized line of huum-only machines. They are designed to be very durable, able to enter a kind of coma-state when not active and requiring very low energy levels. 
	○	Skin is reddish. While they have multiple energy sources, they sometimes feed on small amounts of huum blood. 
	○	Behavioral modules were designed to make the units attractive to huums, but tend to come across like sluts. More or less the original ho’s of the Jaxen world, they were designed mainly to gather information on how to infiltrate huum communities. Often subject to abuse and jokes.

7.x.x. “Plant Bugs” or “Miris”
	○	Jaxen 7.0.0 are very specialized insect-style machines. They emulate the shape and feel of various plants, but are also mobile to some degree — usually moving very slowly. 
	○	They are deployed primarily as information-gathering devices.
	○	Jaxen 7.4.0 are called “Assassins”. A more highly developed form of the “Scorpion Bugs”, they move about more quickly and conceal a potent paralyzing stinger.  Once an Assassin has immobilized its prey, then typically either huum-Jaxen or Striders are called in to take it away to the Home Caves.
	○	Jaxen 7.13.0 are called “Ambush Bugs”. Having even more advanced camouflage than other Miris, they are deployed mainly in the lower hills of the Krunkinotto to defend the Jaxen caves and ward off intruders. 

8.x.x. “Seed Bugs” or “Suckers”
	○	Jaxen 8.0.0 are the next-generation of “Bed Bugs”. Skin is glossy and much more similar to varieties of huum skin.  Instead of being blood-suckers, they are adept at sipping, umm, “nectars” from both male and female huums. 
	○	Jaxen 8.7.0 are also capable of injecting nano-particles into huums which can be used track movements, gather bio-chemical data and, to a small extent, influence behavior.

9.x.x “Stink Bugs”
	○	Jaxen 9.0.0 are the latest release. Most of the units referred to as “Jax” are this variety. 
	○	Mostly huum, they are the most realistic to date, and are often employed as servants in inns, among groups of travelers, in farms and manufactories, and so on.  
	○	They get their name due to their rudimentary digestion system, which mimics huum functioning but evacuates less often and when it does, tends to produce more gas and a stronger stench. 
	○	Jaxen 9.3.0, which will be deployed for the first time when the Bugs attack the Northeast in earnest, are called “Soldier Bugs”. They are kind of a huum-insect cross, with shield-like armor and spines sticking out of their fore-arms. This is the first Jaxen model that can reproduce itself, with some specialized units, once disabled, then dropping eggs which quickly develop into new units, albeit smaller than the original.

            <Title>Kaharan</Title>
            <Text>Kaharan
Early 20's • Barbol/Heliohlan

Role in Story
Kaharan is a rural Settany person caught up in the machinations of a Heliop town. The mother/father come to visit when Kaharan is being held in Heliohlan. In this encounter a variety of Bordawood Fatunik minor characters are encountered as well.

See the scene: "Death of a candlemaker"
Goal
Kaharan is fond of and knowledgeable about many aspects of the diverse Dauni Vakasaqua communities.  She interweaves love of plants, of friends, of community, of family, and knowledge of gardening into her story-telling.  She is acutely concerned with the dire situation with hunger in the Lands, the critical importance of the pollinators, the desperation that ensues from the Hunger.

A little bit of Gretel from Hansel and Gretel. A rural innocent preyed up by both bad and good 'witches'. 

Physical Description

Dauni Vakasaqua come in many sizes, shapes, forms and have multiple names.  Love of gardening, use of herbs for healing and so on is a practice that crosses over the religious/ideological/genetic divides. There are both Fatunik and Lunik Dauni Vakasaqua, and from other traditions too.  Their knowledge and practices are similar.  They can and do learn from each other, providing an important bridge between the communities, in some ways like the Returner cults, who also cross over the political and ideological divides.

A spiritual and pastoral herbalism is very strong south of the rivers, where it takes on a religious character inter-twined with the Earth-centric/animist beliefs of many residents, and tied together with their understanding of the river-soul, of nature as a living, sentient or nearly-sentient entity, the veneration of Malavorra, and so on. 
Personality
Kaharan's family are from the Settany countryside outside of Barbol Toon, between the Ring and the River Setta.  This is a Sogomsh speaking area where devotions to the River-Soul are widespread.  

Occupation
In the terms used by southerners, she is a Gardener (or Herbalist, but I don't want to use that term) as opposed to a Farmer. This reflects her deeper knowledge of plant life, pollination techniques, and so on. 

Kaharan went across the river looking for a special type of herb thought to grow only in the Borda Woods, in order to treat an illness in the village back home. One thing led to another and it ended up being a trip all the way to Heliohlan —  at the invitation of some kindly Fatunik Dauni Vakasaqua met along the way. An opportunity arose to get a job with higher pay and greater prestige than could be obtained in short time going through the lengthy apprentice process back home. 

One there, things got dicey. 

Habits/Mannerisms


Background

Kaharan’s story intersects with B'arqo’s, Allane's and others'.
Internal Conflicts
She has knowledge of the location of some of the rare roots of Terpinol, a legendary root vegetable said to grant longevity.  This is not something to be shared with the shorter-lived Heliops, but is tempted to do so.  Her relationship with Allane is a love interest, a Romeo/Juliet situation. 

External Conflicts
Tried to leave town without permission in a strictly controlled Fatunik town — Heliohlan. Taken into custody. Had to pay a fine but didn’t have the money to pay it. Released due to help from Dauni Vakasaqua located in Fatunik territory, but still forbidden to leave town.  Must report to the Fatune Tagabant every week, which includes indoctrination into Sun-worship.  Parents come to help him/her get home, are disappointed/afraid of the extent to which offspring has been both abused by and won over by the Heliops. 

Notes
Need to flesh out the family more, where they come from in the South, etc.

Multiple names

Role in Story

Military outpost located in Liganalupán run by the Rider Arms, with the veneer of being run by the Fatunika.  A Fatunik Scholar officially presides over the camp and there are barracks for the Fatunik Volunteers there.  But in Camp Borda the local offices are entirely manned by the Rider Arms on behalf of the Heliocastronic Center.

   Despite its relatively mundane appearance as a well-kept military enclosure, the camp contains some interesting and sophisticated resources. As with Borded, though less obviously so, it is very difficult for strangers to approach the camp  undetected.  Unlike Borded, entry into the camp is not permitted without invitation.  The camp is a military outpost that also provides certain types of specialized training, mainly for Riders but also for Fatunik Volunteers and others willing to pay for the privilege of having access to Bordeddi training, technology and techniques.

            <Text>Spirituality

Along with the general outlines of the Fatunik belief systems described elsewhere, the Saskan Lands are home to wide variety of river-soul cults centered in the South with a focus on the River Setta.

There are also distinct folk beliefs among the Eelani, the Kahila, the Mobablbesq, and others, as well as the Runic traditions of Bye and Nye. 

Some of the more commonly held ancient animist or related beliefs are reflected in the calendrical systems, particularly the ones describing motion of the two moon, specific wanderers (near planets, brightest stars), tidal activity, or whose calendrical-system is based entirely on ethical-cultural concepts.

Card Number: 23
+ / -  Main conflicts in this scene.

SPQ makes his case and is rebutted by Tonedo and Bud Starga, who has taken on the persona of an Elder Scholar from the Fatunik Scribes guild. 

Monmar Massachawa throws off her disguise, speaks up in defense of her son, causes a stir. 

&gt; &lt;  Main events, resolutions, actions in this scene.

Continuing directly from chapter 17. They spring Xavi and then make their way to the Great Temple of the Sun where the Argument is held, joining the spectators disguised as... Well, Mobali scholars, I suppose.)

This is the first "Big Radio" scene. A good deal of exposition by Stanley, Tonedo and Bud Starga, but the speechifying is electric! A huge crowd has gathered to hear the debate, aroused by the call that SPQ had issued, that Waleran had echoed, that Birakay had basically sung the harmony to, and against the background of anger and resentment about the treatment of Iohane and Henqu.  The crowd is restless and reacts strongly to the arguments, some agreeing with Stan, others calling for his death. Stan is clearly getting rattled. 

As Tonedo and Bud fire their rhetorical arrows, MM whips up a storm and causes a near riot. She and Xavi and Kam flee during the mayhem. Her intervention once again steels SPQ's resolve. 

Consider -- is this our next death? Is Xavi captured, injured, killed during the escape? Could that intensify the idea that Stan (and Ramona) might seek revenge? Or will they continue to talk?

Finish --&gt; Kam spots a heavily cloaked Ramona, along with other Traveling Sisters whom he recognizes, standing near to Shown Wing, who has arrived as the main delegate for the Byenung, among the crowd as they are exiting in a hurry, being chased by his fellow guards, who are calling him out as a traitor. 
Timeline

Action --&gt;  Real time, continuing from Chapters 17 and the dramatic ending of 18.
Beauty

A mother's love is fierce. Stan is a cute lion cub. His mother standing behind him is ferocious.
Humor

Work with the crowd. It can be something like a Shakespearean or Greek chorus.  Some quick quips. 
Truth

Power never concedes anything without a struggle.   
Impact

Perhaps things can be worked out with words. That big build-up to a thunderclap... Perhaps it introduces the eschaton, not another apocalypse?  Will reason win? Can it? Why won't Stan let his mother rescue him?

            <Title>In the Garden - Scene 4</Title>
            <Synopsis>In an Octopuses Garden</Synopsis>
            <Text>The Jax took them down an ill-lit hallway to an ornately-carved door.  First using a combination of small keys on a lock that was hard to see,  Kirill then tapped on a series of the decorative dentils, spoke a brief enchantment, something like “Vwah! La! Say! Saa!”, and they heard three large bolts unbolting.  The door slowly opened inwards.
Once they were beyond the door, Master Kirill motioned for the Lookie to get lost. He settled onto a small ornate chair and gestured for B'arqo to make himself comfortable on a pile of pillows and throw-rugs. After circling around a few times, to get a good look at the place and because that’s what always felt like the right thing to do before sitting down, B'arqo settled himself and directed one rather large and, if you looked carefully, somewhat pointy, ear cocked in Kirill’s direction, his eyes and especially his nose taking in what he soon grasped to be rather unusual surroundings.
Stepping through the door, they’d left behind a large, noisy, ill-lit, smoky room filled with an eclectic mix of sints touching every data point on the spectrum from puros to impuros. Sniffing around, B'arqo saw they had stepped into a quiet, tranquil space lit by an ambient greenish-Pavan hue.  He was entranced by the sound of quietly gurgling water.

Once his eyes adjusted to the light, he saw they were surrounded on three sides by a see-through enclosure, with walls of a solid but clearly transparent and largely scent-free substance.  Could it be ice? 
The transparent walls were neither freezing-cold nor melting. They were, however,  holding back a sizable body of water.  On the other side of the ice-but-not-really-ice walls were varieties of shell-like enclosures, and what B'arqo recognized from his journeys on the Krbshanana Sea as coral structures.  A light source emanated from within the watery realm.  
Kirill said nothing while B'arqo sussed out his surroundings.  As he surveyed the scene, the old song catcher searched his mind to recall a word he’d heard used for the first time during a retreat, many moon-turns back, with a small team of mostly puro adepts from the Society for the Reinvention of Aesthetics. They’d spent several days and nights, adorned only in simple purple cloaks, discussing and debating a proposed “revolutionary strategy for developing fully autonomous inter-sentient art forms as a means towards strengthening the post-structural transformation of private and inter-subjective spaces with an eye towards developing a popular communicative rationality that would, in time, lead to...”
Well, let’s just say, to good things for all the sints. At least that was the idea. 
B'arqo noticed something moving about in the water, half-hidden among the shells and coral.  It had tentacles.  Much like the Seffs at the bar.  

“This is where the barkeeps live when they’re not working,” Kirill squeaked. “As far as I can tell, only the males leave the water-garden. The females never do.  That’s their deal. I call it the water-garden because...”
“Ah! Yes. It’s an aquarium!”, Baraflot interrupted in standard Eibarq, remembering at last the ancient word he’d been searching for.  
“Ah. Kwaa. What?” 
“It’s a word from one of the Ancient Tongues,” B'arqo explained, “Aqua meant water and Rium meant, we believe, something like a watch-hold. So an ‘aqau-rium’ is where they imprisoned water-dwelling creatures, either for amusement or in preparation for slaughtering and eating them.”  
“Oh, sure, like a fish tank. We have one out back.  We keep the eatables from the Pavan in there until we’re ready to serve them to our flesh-eating customers. Mostly we buy from Byenung. Some from indie flesh-hunters.” Kirill matter-of-factly explained.
B'arqo, who, after a great deal of internal grappling with ethics, had abandoned flesh-eating many turns ago, looked down sadly for a few moments, but didn’t say anything. 
“Well, yes, but an aquarium was... well, evidently it had magical walls... like this material... a watery enclosure that you could see through. I had always thought that was just ancient myth.  But here it is.”  
B'arqo didn’t bother to share how one of the SRA adept had also posited that aquarium “was a potentially useful metaphor for developing an modified ontology that opens a space to create inter-subjective ironic distances for bridging communicative gaps regarding power and equality without over-disrupting deeply-programmed structural-identity concepts of terra/torial permanence”. 
“Yeah, dunno how they did that,” Kirill said. “Seffy multi-brains, you know?  Whatever.  They did the set up.  Super-duper smarty pants of the sea and all that. Cost me a pretty bucket of big chits, I’ll tell ya that. But worth it. Best barkeeps in the business.  Keep to themselves too.  Not always up in your business like some busy-bodies.”
He stared rather dramatically at B'arqo at that point.
Choosing not to take the bait, B'arqo looked around some more and said, “So you call it a water-garden, eh? That makes sense. I suppose.  Hmmmmmm. Yes. Because it’s like being under the sea, isn’t it?” 
B'arqo stared at his host with a quizzical look on his face.

Kirill stood up. Tapped his glowy stick on the floor boards as he spoke, betraying some impatience with B'arqo’s tendency toward analyzing everything to within an inch of its life, then making obscure jokes that nobody got.
“Anyway. You said you had something important to tell me?”
“First. Remind me. You are pledged to the sacred bonds of the Annaka Intimi, are you not, old friend?”, B'arqo asked.
Sitting back down but with is back held up very straight, in a commanding manner, Kirill said very quietly and entirely seriously, “You know very well that I am.” 
“And as the Master of the clan of the Manifold Ways, not to mention as proprietor of this renowned establishment, you have a large community to whom you are responsible as well.”
“Yes, that is also true. And I am dues-paying member of the Free Innkeepers Guild too. And if you must know, I supply the good s’lah to all the basherbazooki barracks on the sly as well.  And at a handy profit.  Any other nosy questions?”
“The Free Innkeepers Guild charges no dues payments that I am aware of,” B'arqo growled. The menace in his tone spoke volumes.
“Figure of speech. Figure of speech.  Moons and stars. Wanderers and bards.  You don’t have to be so literal about everything. What is this, a Byenungian inquisition into my business affairs? Damn mages.”
“As I’m sure you are well aware,” B'arqo lied, ”there is no such things as a Mages Guild. You know very well that I am a rationalist.  And that I make a perfectly honest living with the Harpers and Bards of the Two Rivers.”
“All right then. Let’s not play word games.  To be precise," Kirill lied in turn, "I am merely a senior consultant to the eastern free innkeepers bookkeepers fraction of the Free Hostelries Cooperative. So. As I am sure you know, that means I pretty much have to provide free goodies to whatever Riders show up at my door.  Pretty much the same thing as paying dues, innit?  Wouldn’t you say?”
“Fair enough. I see what you mean,” the old philosopher concurred. “It is your role as an, err, umm, let’s say as an honest broker, and as head of an important sint-clan, that interests me more than your fealty to Borded.”
“Fealty? Fealty! Now, that’s a strong quaff of stale s'lah, B'arqo. I know the old songs as well as you do. I have plenty of friends in Byenung and even a few Alferine acquaintances too, as I am sure you are aware. But. Submitted.  Yes. Cross-born. True. As charged. I supposed I do prefer doing business with the Riders rather than moons-forsaken, sun-sucking Heliops whenever possible.  But ‘fealty’? Really, old friend? Really?...”

B'arqo trained his soulful brown eyes upon the diminutive Gekkota-sint’s big pupils, whose wide-awake nature was so characteristic of the Squamata order.  He pondered for a while life without eyelids, trying to have compassion for what it must be like to never close ones eyes.  
He blinked automatically himself when he saw Master Kirill, seemingly without thinking about it twice, lick his eyeballs clean.  
“Holy Juuj”, B'arqo thought to himself, “this little guy could never pass for puros in a million moons.”
In a quiet voice, using the Beetish argot lest any of those octo-lasses had ways of listening in to their conversation through the bizarrely warm ice, B'arqo told Master Kirill what he’d learned about the so-called Royal Empafarasi.  
He confirmed that the longstanding rumors were, in fact, true. 
Or true-ish at any rate.
Or might have some inkling of truth about them.
More pertinent to a confidential chat with a fearsome leader of one of the larger romperi guilds, he described what he’d discovered in the ancient ruins far to the South, deep in the fabled Grumsh-speaking Lands of Groomsh: what appeared to be some sort of [ancient apparatus for communicating remotely over long distances] flying mechanism. 
As he’d hoped, the potential for profits to be acquired from the combination of these two tales quickly caught Master Kirill’s close attention. 

As they talked on into the night, their good s’lah being refreshed from time to time by the Jax, and just as B'arqo had hoped it would, the possibilities for serious political and cultural impacts resulting from these discoveries, if certain arrangements could be taken and various alliances forged, also began to take shape in the large and active mind of the diminutive Supreme Warden of the Annaka Intimi.</Text>

            <Text>Hopefully some of this can be generated by software. 

Don’t want to repeat / copy items found in Gamma World, though some “odes” would be appropriate. 
In some respects, open odes to Gamma World would be cool, and maybe a nice “hook” into a special audience that can be the trigger.
Don’t want to over-do, especially in the Saskan Lands. Leave more exotic stuff for the Ilyushan, the Forg, the Krbsh Sea, Krbshanana and the Komexicon.

Struggling to find the right balance of “mutants”, sentient animal-sints, and “powers”. Not really eager to create a “superpower” story. Though I would like it make for a good graphic novel.

I do want to have some “talking animal” characters — rabbits, turtles, octopuses, geckos, something like a dragon (maybe) — but want to avoid anything that has been done before (dogs, cats, bears, horses). OK, well rabbits in “Watership Down”, but I’d love to take THAT to the next level.


Part of the “twist” will be that some “normal” species (from the reader’s perspective) have been — or have been thought to be — extinct for a long time.  The revitalization of these species either due to recurrence of natural selection, isolation, or through the engineering of the Agency or other players — needs to cause as much emotional shock/excitement as introduction of creatures that don’t exist in the reader’s world at all.

The big “twist” I am working with is the complete lack of flying creatures, even bugs, in the Saskan Lands and nearby. 

Not all “beasts” are “evil”. 

Some of the beasts I’d like to work with include:

After birds are re-introduced...
- Carrion Vultures: basically the same as we have, but bigger and willing to eat larger finds
- Giant Ravens: likewise, but even bigger, even more sentient and not mixed


- Giant Wolves: very dangerous
- Ghost Wolves
- Tree Spirits
- “Land Sharks”: big snakes/worms that travel underground. Very dangerous
- Lizard Bush: an aggressive and poisonous plant
- Dragon Bugs: very large insects, aggressive, a bit like the bugs in Starship troopers (accidentally introduced by early Agents)
- Jackalopes: pathological rabbits
- Orange Scarfers: pathological rodents

+ / -  Main conflicts in this scene.

On a small island in the Remari Archipelago, where, following Snek's directions, the key to opening the Jars was found, and where the first birds began following the pollinator's ship (what is that ship called, btw?) back to the Saskan Lands...

A tree is rapidly growing and developing at the spot where the key was removed. It is massive, sending out roots, reaching far up into the sky, tearing things up.

During a bright night that is a conjunction of several full moons, in a grove protected by the great tree, from deep in the water, a huge egg breaks open.

Snek descends from the great tree to watch as a creature is born. It slithers into the ocean, where there is a great commotion of waves, sending a tsunami towards the Lands.  It rises up into the sky, carrying and creating a great wind that rips across the waters. Rising, rising, it blots out the light of the moons, casting the world into a great darkness. 

&gt; &lt;  Main events, resolutions, actions in this scene.

We have seen the creature before. Where did it go? How is this scene different from the previous one?  A matter of scale? Perhaps in the previous scene, we show the creature diving back into the Earth at the place where the "key" (the jars) was removed. Now it is re-emerging.

Finish --&gt; Fade to black, then stars and moons re-appear, a green comet is receding.

Beauty

A gaggle of kites sail back and forth in the wind.
Humor

A fishing boat is rocked by a large wave; its crew laughs and jokes. 
Truth

The eldest of the Elders sees a disturbance deep in the Pool. There is a rumbling, followed by even bigger ripples on the waters than in our opening (which I need to add, so there will be a nice wrap-up!).  

Impact

What am I feeling now?

            <Text>Enclosure and Agency

Need to explain all this for myself, even if not explicitly described in the story or game. 

I expect it to be a key theme in the overall epic, revealing its true nature over time and eventually leading to characters "breaking out" of it to explore a wider universe. 

The Saskan Lands and most of the rest of the continent are contained in a high-tech bubble of which most residents are unaware. Possibly more than one layer of bubble.  

The Agency is an intra-galactic organization chartered with overseeing the safe-keeping and development of damaged systems and civilizations who have nearly wrecked their own planet and may present a danger to the rest of the galaxy.  
The planet where our story takes place is such a place.  The horrific actions of previous generations nearly ruined this planet and several nearby ones and threatened to bring such bad behaviors further out into the galaxy.  
Apocalyptic collapses prevented too much damage, but there was concern that they might re-build and do it all over again.  So they were Enclosed. 

This is far from a well-developed method or science and it is rife with its own ineptness, uncertainties, lapses and so forth.  At its worst, an Enclosed area becomes a kind of playground for messing around with DNA and social controls.  
The Agency are like gods, but not necessarily very good or adept ones.  Greek gods at best.

Historical Summary
Like Eibar and Juujal, Pavanarune is thought to be one of the longest continually settled (by huum) areas of the Saskan Lands.  The Toon of Pavanarune is a major trading port for goods moving along the coast or coming in from Ilyushan, Forgh, or the Krbsh Sea.
Physical Description

The Toon of Pavanarune, similar to Ingar on the other side of the Pavan, has long been a protector of the Pavan against intruders from the sea.  However, unlike Ingar, it lies close the water's edge and has thus been subject to tidal flooding, storm damage and direct assault from enemies in a way that Ingar has not had to endure.

This has made the Pavanarunic folk tough and hardy, with a deserved reputation for ferocity and cleverness. 

The other major Toon officially within the borders of the province is Ríkila, which lies right on the Ring Road on the very edge of The Barbakal and a short route to the coast, and just north of the border with semi-autonomous Mobalbesq to the south. An uprising occurred there about 30 years prior to our story line.  Referred to as the Event in Ríkila, it left the town split into two halves, the eastern half dominated by the Fatunik Tagabant and the western half an anarchic enclave loosely affiliated with both the Night Hall and the Kahilafolk.

On top of that, the brutal fighting was ended due an intervention by the Empafarasi, whose forces came all the way from the Mistral Tower to weigh in on the side of the rebels. Ríkila is thus the only outpost of direct Empafarasi influence outside of their stronghold in the far-western Weir Lands.

Also see Setting Sketch

Type of Location
The mouth of the Pavan River, where it empties into the Krbsh Sea, forms a deep gorge between Ingar and Pavanrune and on into the Pavan Bay in the Krbsh Sea.

Where the Rocking River drains into the Pavan Gorge is huge waterfall.

The waterfall, as well as tidal effects on the lower part of the Gorge, where it becomes an estuary into the Bay, makes navigation up-river from the sea a challenge . The high walls of the Gorge make it well-protected area for its inhabitants, which explains at least in part why Eibar and Pavanrune are considered to be the oldest (longest-inhabited) of the Saskan provinces.

Card Number: 20
+ / -  Main conflicts in this scene.

A split on the Borded Council is resolved by compromise.

Syncronicity. South meets North in western context on the Ring outside Eelan.

Petra Bearbek leaves her enclave in the Kahila Woods to engage the Dauni Vakasaqua in the developing uprising, by bringing Malavorra out onto the Ring Road. This creates a sensation through the Settan Lands. They offer protection to Allane and Kaharan, to the consternation of the DV elders who oppose fomenting any conflicts with the Heliops.

&gt; &lt;  Main events, resolutions, actions in this scene.

Barq Rob-Eye, from the Eelani Hills, brings an Argument to the Riders Council in Borded in support of Waleran and SPQ.  He persuades them to back SPQ.  Otto Trucent agrees with him, cementing a split in the Borded Council. 

As a compromise, it is decided to send a Rider Army east to secure the Ilyushan, coincidentally traveling thru Beshquohuk and offering support for Stanley's argument. 

Barq and Otto travel back to Eelan to raise a militia, where Waleran has now arrived following his mission to the Mistral Tower, accompanied by representatives of the Empafarsi.

The Eelani chatter about whether a New Wall of Fire is immanent. They vote to join the Rider Army heading East and encourage the Empafarasi to provide support.

Petra and Malavorra check the status of wind-mills as they make their journey west, which is a way of leaving messages for Maatsuuv. They encourage Allane and Kaharan to take a detour into Eelani, where they all meet up with the Empafarasi representatives (need some character development here -- my old hero "H'gar the Windlord" perhaps? But named something like Phaeron, who asked Zeus to let him drive his chariot across the sky. There will be hubris, a challenge to the "gods", retribution...  Need some good Eelani characters too. Part Dionysius, part Heracles I think. Dwarvish.  Petra calls on the "bones of our mother" to join them and is answered by the Untamed. 

(See chapter 18 -- some of that may go here)

Finish --&gt; A noisy rabble-y armed force pours down from the Eelani Heights, joined by Riders from the northern Rider provinces, with Empafarasi rangers embedded with them. And joined by Petra Bearbek and Malavorra, plus a significant force of the Untamed, and various Others. Another dance.

Timeline

Action --&gt;  Picking up from Chapter 11.  Some minor flashback/rewind, playing forward to the same point in time as the conclusion of Chapter 16, then continuing.
Beauty

The small resurgence of life in the blasted zone where the Wall of Fire scorched the earth. The March of the Outcasts. 
Humor

Petra Bearbek gives no fucks whatsover.
Truth

A strong heart is more powerful than strong arms.   
Impact

The wisdom of the adepts brings what is below to what is above and what is above to what is below, wherefore worlds rejoice together.

            <Text>The Untamed
Militant, Revolutionary • Many small cells

Role in Story
A bit of Monty Python with a nod to Watership Down.  Sympathetic animal-centered story-telling.  Push on the huum / others-with-consciousness boundaries.

Relationship to Other Organizations
Amorphous and multi-faceted. Bitterly in conflict with Heliops and Riders and other huum-centric groups.  Mixed support among mixed populations. They are the far-left (or maybe the far-right) to Byenung’s liberalizing reforms.

Description
A widely dispersed movement, occasionally with attempts to make it into a broader Front. Made up of many factions, some of which bitterly oppose each other. United in their fear and distrust of the huum. Bearers of multi-faceted long-standing unresolved internal conflicts between carnivore and herbivore/scavenger conscious species. Problematizations of deep ethonology. Dealing with the boundaries between animals with advanced/enhanced consciousness and those with ordinary animal-level consciousness. 

Roles of Members
Guerilla cells carry out various attacks on huum and collaborator targets ranging from violent assaults to propaganda stunts.  

Types/Personalities of Members
Vast majority are hares and rabbits. Only a few carnivore-oriented cells, though those are the most-feared… wolves, bears, coyotes.  Lots of young radicals trying to impress each other.  

Industrial, Economic or Cultural Role
Minimal, except when the cells are tied into an older, more established network. Maatsuuv’s Food Thought network is the most exceptional one and it also provides safe haven, deep underground, literally, for young militants on the run.

Habits/Dress / Mannerisms of Members
Berets and bandoliers are popular. Rhythmic foot-stomping is a trademark protest ritual.

Background
The Enclosure affected a small number of animals by increasing their neo-cortex or equivalent mechanisms. As opposed the much more numerous grafts of animal traits into largely huum bodies. Some physiological changes are evident. Usually larger head sizes with correspondingly broader neck and and shoulder bones and and muscles. In most cases, spoken speech also emerged at a higher level, though almost never at the level of huum vocal chords. Larger mouths in some cases, with labial modifications, are the obvious markers. These changes propagated especially in the rapid-reproducing rabbit and hare populations.

A Moon

Role in Story
Both of the moons of Gavor have a geo-synchronous orbit with the planet.
Endor is the more distant but larger moon.

The ASS Visitor (ummm....  no... much as I love Seth Macfarlane, that's not really what I'm going for here... Be a little more subtle with the ass jokes...) maintains a geo-synchronous orbit stationed above the dark side of Endor, keeping it always out of sight from Gavor.

Let's change the moons thing from 2 moons to 8 moons. Play around a little bit, but not too obviously, with the bagua.

            <Title>Beat Sheet</Title>
            <Text>This is an adaptation of Blake Snyder’s Beat Sheet for a successful screen play. My thought here isn’t to stick to it precisely (he insists on specific # of pages, with specific things on specific pages) — but to help craft the story in a dramatic, interesting direction.

Re-arrange scenes as needed to align with this pattern.

The length of each beat is expressed as a percentage of the whole, rather than as a precise number of pages. Use this pattern to focus attention on where to tighten things up, where to expand. My rough percentages are out of 110%.  Because we also go the extra mile…. ;-) 

Roughly placing the scenes I’ve outlined so far to see if they can fit this pattern.

I did cards on a white board as well, but then seem to have lost my initial edits based on the card, which then got a bit mixed up. Am reviewing the whole thing to slot the card notes in appropriately. Things to clarify include...

- Who is the main character in a given scene?
- What voice/point-of-view is used in the scene?
- What is the main conflict in the scene?
- What gets resolved within the scene? 
- What is left hanging?

===================================

The cards as identified here are not necessarily in synch with the ones that ended up on the whiteboard, and are represented in the Manuscript outline. Think of the following as a first draft of the beat sheet.

I like the overall flow developed here, but needs more.

==================================



1. Opening Scene (1%)

ACT ONE
Celebrations

- Grab attention!  Introduce the problem resolved later.
- Introduce the main character --&gt; Stanley Phoenix Quinn
- Introduce at least several of the other main characters --&gt;
	B'arqo, Waleran, Showan, Birakay

Bar scene in Ríkila is good, but it needs to…
- Have B'arqo meet several of the main characters in the pub.
- Put SPQ there.
	- He’s on his way to present his findings to the authorities in Juuj.
	- Show his flaws. 
	- Nobody believes or understands him.
	- He is socially inept.
	- He gets rescued by his sidekicks — Showan and the Jax waiter, who should develop into the character Remanj Jexan
- He gets overheard by the Watch, who report on him
- The order is put out to take him under guard.
	- Introduce Tonedo
- He is taken away


2. Theme Stated (4.5%)

 The Splendid Boys

- Pose a question or make a statement, probably to SPQ, that will be the theme of the movie.
- Maybe this is after B'arqo and Kirill meet and encounter SPQ again as they’re leaving
- Work on their meeting as way to introduce some of the other main characters whom they are planning a trip to the town of Morilly in Mobalbesq to meet…
- Bring in more of the background on SPQ — what is he doing here? What is his mission? 
- Hint at the B Story -- the other threats — Ilyushan, Forgh, Jaxen, barbarians)


3. Set-up (3.5%, building on 1 and 2)

Northward to Sorrow — SPQ is taken to Juuj, among other things
Holidays Among the Kahila — a cohort follows 

- Be sure to initiate some running gags and call-backs at this juncture
- The ineptitude of the “advanced aliens” (the Agency) should be a running joke
   - They never do solve anything
   - They can’t agree with each other
   - Their interventions may have done more harm than good
   - There is no clear plan in what they are doing
   - The Enclosure itself is full of holes


4. Catalyst (1%)

The Great Auction — synch this up with SPQ’s trial? 
- Make it punchier.
- Move more of the character development to the next section


5. Debate (11%, starting from 4 and ending on 6)

The Great Auction, continued. 
Into the Nye Lands
 Legends of Massachawa
 Cool Cats  — Replace Dex with Showan (a Prince to his pauper cousin)  

- Make sure we’re focusing on supporting (or not) SPQ’s contentions 
	— can we save the world?  
    — If he is right, then what do we need to do to save the world?
    — Is that more important than the threat from Ilyushan?

6. Break into Two (1%)

The Blessed Flames — similar to the Great Auction, synch this to arguments in the trial of SPQ.  The fate of Iohane and Henqu makes us fearful for SPQ’s life. We’ve learned that the Lands are in grave danger. We’re not sure yet which threat is the worst one. But now it’s clear that SPQ’s life is in danger.




7. B Story (1%)

ACT TWO
The Glorious Sky — splash page.

8. Fun and Games (23%, starting from 7 and ending on 9)

The Glorious Sky, continued
Sniffing Out the Problem
Mother Knows Best
A Quest for Madness
Rolling on the River

- We seem to be on an entirely different theme..
- Talking about flying, aliens, botany.
- A good place to introduce other characters
- The upside-down version of Act One.
- The Saskan Lands from the Kahila, Setta, Mobalbesq, Bye, Nye, Weir Lands, etc. POV's
- The promise of the premise should show up here.. The movie poster refers to this.
   - The bunnies with guns
   - The problem with bugs
   - Aliens with problems of their own
- Question is —&gt; does our hero get lost in this part? 
   - If he is off in Juuj getting judged, then what are all these folks doing 
     in this story?
   - Do we need to spring him? 
   - Is Showan the real hero?
   - Need to figure this out.

Sailing on the Seas
Wing Island

- I like the movement in two directions.
- Maybe want to intersperse them rather than putting the sea voyage at the end

- Perhaps I need to pick two SPQ “avatars”, like representative heroes during this phase.
   — I think Showan and Kirill are my best bets. Send Kirill out to sea.

- What is Birakay doing during all of this?
- Likewise, who are my alternative villains? — Jesse K, introduce the assassin of Birakay (is it Bu’ruq?.. And who sets him up?), Mur’ray — another tragic villain.  Calley Coola.  
- Those tragic villains are all interesting. Probably just need to have like “night rider” kind of agents from the Center following/tracking our alt-heroes.
- The Jaxen should also represent a “true” villain — one that resonates deeply but doesn’t have to be spelled out too much. They are ALSO representative of science, of the new technology, and indeed they will assist in (re-)introducing pollination to the Lands. But their totally machine-based life forms should give pause.
- Luvcando , Monmar, Grim Malek, Rillbeck the Runner — villain-ish characters who aren’t really evil and are kind of dark-huumr relief


9. Midpoint (1%)

Good Morning, Saskantinon!

- Raise the stakes and present a false victory.
- Move at least an image of the return of voyagers and the rallying of the Volunteers to here.



10. Bad Guys Close In (18%, starting from 9 and ending on 11)


Attack from all directions
Resistance comes to the rescue
Resistance fighters are betrayed
Resistance fighters are massacred
Empafarasi turn back the barbarians
Heliop volunteers and Empafarasi turn back the monsters
Tonedo launches his final Argument against SPQ


11. All is Lost (1%)

Birakay is almost assassinated
Tonedo wraps up his final Argument against SPQ

12. Dark Night of the Soul (7%, starting from 11 and ending on 13)

Weir Lands are nearly overrun. Help arrives from Aranzen. (twist — new characters revealed)
Riders oppose the persecution of SPQ
The south rises in revolt



13. Break into Three (1%)

ACT THREE
SPQ defends himself


14. Finale (20%, starting from 13 and ending on 15)

The Miners of Eelan - maybe even do a fun little historical retro here?
The Riders revolt
The Jaxen Renaissance
Rebellion in Beshquohuk — yeah, this goes here
The air flotilla arrives in the Juuj
The Agency goes on as usual — nothing has really changed, they are still inept
SPQ is acquitted
Everyone unites to drive back the monsters


15. Final Image (1%)
Soon after, flying things appear throughout the lands, pollinating stuff
- We see SPQ helping to direct operations, or at least enjoying the sight of butterflies

CODA:
- Snek has stayed on Wing Island. CERB arises.

SECOND CODA:
- Jax Control is studying rocketry

            <Text>Mixry
Role in Story
Ramona lives in a sequestration village just outside of Mixry.

The team working to support SPQ goes there to see if she can provide them with information about the Terrapinas, who are rumored to have knowledge of pollination techniques that predated the arrival of Heliops and Riders, and possibly predated the Catastrophe.

It is also a center of intrigue and danger regarding suspected influx of "barbarians" from the north, who Tagabants claim have a Fifth Column in Mixry. Along with all the other things going on, a kind of revolt of the Wesshewen workers spreads from Mixry. This is not actually the same thing, or even directly related to, armed attacks from northern raiders, but Fatunik propaganda portrays it that way, making life even more difficult for the I.W.W. population.

Season


Unique Features
One of the few places in the Saskan Lands where there is a fairly significant population of "foreigners". In this case, folks -- mainly huum -- who came in from the north, the Lands of Wesshewen, seeking sanctuary, safety and/or work in the relatively prosperous and secure borders of the Fatunika.  They mainly do "dirty work" in the fields, ranches and mines (mainly peat-bog) of Norgyte, Salotriza and Givákala and are registered officially as "Internal Wesshewen Workers".   Often underpaid and treated badly, but coming from a land where people are traditionally strong, self-sufficient and free (in the way that pirates are free), the I.W.W's are a constant source of labor strife, going on strike, making demands and so on. 

Description
A desolate watch-tower town on the northern frontier, in the province of Norgyte. Officially managed by the Authority, but rule of law in the town itself is very limited and observance of the duties almost non-existent. 

Full of mercenaries, thieves and con-artists. A few skilled assassins operate from there. 

A haven for mixed- and powered folks in the northeast

Just outside of town are sequestration villages where the Fatunika parks persons deemed a danger to public order and so on, but who have not been condemned for crimes and whose offenses were not serious enough to merit treatments reserved for heretics.  Some of these are run fairly humanely; others less so.

            <Title>Arq Province</Title>
            <Text>The most remote of the Saskan regions considered to be part of or allied with Sasnkantinon, Arq only very nominally shows fealty to the Center, mainly as a way to avoid the kind of trouble that the Kahila regions have long had with the Fatunika.

Heavily populated by non-huum and partly-huum sints, Arq is similar in some ways to the Komikol and the Krbish Sea. What distinguishes it from those Border Lands is the willingness of its inhabitants to interact with, influence, and learn from the beqqua (huum).  In this sense, it similar to the Runes of Bye, but with a much greater non-huum feeling to it.

Politically and culturally, the Arq Lands are pretty much an anarchist’s wet dream. There is no centralized control of anything and there are hundreds of independent villages, dens, warrens and so on who deal with each other in a more or less rational way without requiring much bureaucracy or ideology. 

The Toon of Barqton — home of our narrator — is one of the smallest of the municipal entities in the Saskan Lands, a very large encampment of dens and warrens and small bazaars.

When used as an adjective, one says Arql. So it is the Land of Arq, but the large inland sea it border and largely encloses is the Arql Sea and the extensive marshy lands that have filled in its connection to the Krbsh Sea are the Arql Marshes. The sentient beings who inhabit the place can be referred to as Arqlers or the Arqli.

Role in Story

The most visible and powerful of the Rider Union organizations, Rider Arms are the protectors and sheriffs of the Ring Roads, an elite fighting force that operates on the northern borders, especially facing threats from Wesshewen and Krunkinotto, and labor enforcers/prison guards at Beet and other locations.

They are also the premier weapons and armor manufacturers in the Saskan Lands, which is the core of their friendly relations with the Heliocastron.

            <Text>Returners
Local cults • All over the place, but especially in the Southwest and Northeast

Role in Story


Relationship to Other Organizations


Description

A widespread cult with many local colors. Basic belief system is that they want to Return to the time before the Catastrophe. 
Dexelites have a syncretic Fatunik-Returner belief system.
Jexans are "cultural" Returners, without a strong belief system, but interested in ancient culture, sometimes easily confused with plain old treasure hunting.

The Dexelites are one of the larger Returner cults. Dexel is thought to have been an author of the Fatunik "Book of Promises", though not all Fatunik scribes agree with this. She is supposedly going to return to the Lands one day with a shining torch, with which she will lead the Faithful to the source of the Old Ways.

The Jexan are another of the larger Returner cults. They are much more diverse and syncretic, adopting and adapting to many different versions of worship/interest-in the ancient past, including things akin to ancestor worship, to fascination with treasure hunting, as well as cargo cult kind of stuff where ancient artifacts are the objects of veneration. Jexa is considered to be the spirit of all things, a somewhat amorphous concept. Not really a god/goddess kind of idea, more like a force that imbues objects -- especially ancient objects -- with energy. 

A sub-group of Jexans venerate Malavorra, the goddess-like southern guru, who is said to personify the spirit of the Setta, referring to her as the Jexan Mother. This makes them one of the most syncretic groups in the Lands.

The Nightingales are a small Returner cult, noteworthy especially for having maintained images of birds in the consciousness of Saskan folks.

            <Title>Summary</Title>
            <Text>Still working on good names for this region.

I like the original name for the mountains themselves: the Krunkinotto.
“Krunkinotto” or “Oknott” just struck me as kind of evocative.

This is the most mountainous region of the “known” world. North of the Weir Lands, the peaks rise higher and higher and become nearly impassable. 

The “created” (Jaxen, etc.) dwell mainly underground and in caverns and canyons in this area, where they can mine for the materials they need to reproduce themselves. Huge fires and smoke sometimes rise from their forges, or if there has been an accident, but generally speaking they are more “Metropolis” than “Mordor”. 

The “Western Enclosure” (the “edge of the world” and so on) is said to be found just beyond the Krunkinotto.  Hard to say, since few travelers have ever survived a journey into the mountains.

The Jaxen are fiercely protective of their enclaves. They watch all movement in the area and will capture or kill any intruders if they can.

Though their actual population is not so large, due mainly to difficulties in managing consistent mobile power supplies (batteries), the underground world of the Jaxen is enormous and reaches into both the Weir Lands and Oknott. 

Reformed Jaxen, robots/clones tied to the infiltration units commonly sent into the Saskan Lands as servants to gather info, tend to cluster in the southern caverns and tunnels, closer to High Weir. This is where their work on mechanized pollination techniques is most advanced and their AI has begun to split off from the collective as it developed increased compassion due to long-term attention to the suffering of the sints, beks and animals. (try to think of some clever Linux jokes to name them)

Inhaaybetants of the northern caverns and tunnels (old hat Unix-y…)  are traditionally more tied to the “old AI”, which perceives huum, in particular, as a threat to survival of the planet. The back story here brings us into another angle regarding the Agency. The created were not simply leftovers from a failed huum experiment eons ago (not just the “Terminator” storyline), but were (at least partly) the result of an earlier attempt by galaxy-traveling folk to usefully mine this planet. Perhaps the Agency was actually founded in order to correct the mistakes of these earlier missions?

            <Title>Mur'ray</Title>
            <Text>Mur’ray [family TBD]
18 • Refugee/Thief/Arsonist
Role in Story
Help to tell the story/background of the Ilyushan Mountains.  Provide an inside view into one of the thieves/assassins guilds. 

Helps to signal the dangers coming from the Ilyushan. Bit of a Paul Revere character.
Goal
Use Mur’ray’s recollections to describe the Toon of Ingar and the region around it.   Something of a villain from a Fatunik perspective.  A negative "bad guy" character, Mur’ray needs both loving kindness and medical attention.
Physical Description
Tall, erect bearing. Striking, handsome/beautiful appearance. Very quick. Has a powerful emotional affect on certain people whom s/he stares at that causes something like a fever in them.  Has minor fire-starting capabilities using fingernails, which are flint-like.   
Personality
Cold, calculating, somewhat pathological. Afraid to develop close relationships.
Occupation
Thief, arsonist.  May have committed several murders. 
Habits/Mannerisms
Uses appearance, speed and emotional fugue to manipulate others.
Background
A refugee from the Ilyushan Mountains, where her clan’s villages came under assault by much more monstrous forces. From her own perspective, she is cultured, a warrior, etc. Has some trouble understanding why the Saskan people fear her. 

Escaped down the [Bighotti] to Ingar. Recruited there by a militant romperi faction from the Kahilakol.  Has been deployed by them in attacks against Fatunik institutions in Ríkila and Rútonik. 
Internal Conflicts
Is literally burning up inside. Suffers a good bit of physical pain.  The fire mutation releases the pain.  Not using it increases internal pressure.  Probably needs medical attention or a more useful way to exercise special abilities, but doesn’t know where/how to get it.
The work with the [romperi outfit] has not yet involved direct acts of assassination, but Mur’ray knows that this is coming and is not entirely down with that.  The “Big Tree” Fatunik Volunteers of Salotrize and Eibar are the main line of defense against the monstrous forces from the Ilyushan Mountains who are coming closer and closer to the border every day.
External Conflicts
Is starting to feel used by the [romperi]. This particular outfit has a cult of martyrdom playing out in their warfare with the Catastrophonics, but it seems to involve mainly the martyrdom of foreign recruits and young people.  The more events, as they call their raids, that are carried out, the more risk Mur’ray faces both in terms of being hurt or killed, and in terms of drawing the attention of the Tagabants, the Special Division and so on.

            <Text>Saskantinon
Role in Story

It is roughly 800 miles / 1,300 kilometers from the western frontier to the middle of the Krbsh Sea.
It is roughly 600 miles / 1,000 kilometers from the Wesshewen frontier to the Kominon Realms.

Let's call it 1,500 km wide by 1,200 km tall, encompassing a good bit of the surrounding regions, as shown on the map. In the USA, this would be roughly from Baton Rouge, LA to Albuquerque, NM and from Brownsville, TX to Wichita, KS.

Located in the south-central region of Lurabar, east of the mountains of Krunkinotto and Aranzen, and west of the Rocking River and the Krbsh Sea. In reference to the two rivers which flow through it, the Pavan and the Setta, the Land of Saskantinon is also called The Land of the Two Rivers or variations on the names of the rivers, like Setta-Pavan, Pavanasetta, Settapavana, and so on.

The region is also referred to as the Saskan Lands, the Ringtoons (LOL - love this... Well, I used to anyway. Not so much any more.), the Saskantoons, the Rivertoons and various other names associated with notable aspects of its character in a synecdochel fashion, referring to the whole by reference to a part: 
	•	Juuj — an ancient name, one of the oldest inhabited areas of the region
	•	Heliocastria — referring to the Fatunik powers that claim to rule the region -- generally just called The Authority
	•	Setta — after the southern river and some of the sub-regions and towns 
	•	Pavania — after the northern river and some of the sub-regions and towns
	•	Bordal or Borded — after the important Rider town of Borded
	•	Besquo or Beshkwoo — after the important Fatunik town of Beshquohuk  


Both rivers originate in the western mountains and flow into the Krbsh Sea. The southern river, the Setta, drains into the Great Lake of Bye, created by the formidable dams built by the inhabitants of Byenung.  Along with its natural course into the Krbsh Sea, now by way of the Lake of Bye, the Setta also drains into and provides navigation to the Bay of Bar to the south. 

The navigable Great Bye Canal ties the Great Lake of Bye to the Bay of Bar.  Another navigable canal, the Bye-Nye Waterway, connects the Great Lake to the Arql Sea

For now, most of the action in the story and the game takes place within the Lands of Saskantinon. 

Importance of the Rivers
Just as the Ring Road ties together Saskan lands, provides a good bit of its security, energizes its commerce and ties together its diverse peoples and sentients, so the Two Rivers bring a flow of life into the region that goes beyond the obvious benefits of navigation, trade, fishing and irrigation. 

The northern river, the Pavan, runs from the northwest to the east through northern Saskantinon. It originates in two main feeder-tributaries.  One, the Borda River, originates in the Krunkinotto mountains.  The other tributary, the Eelian River, flows through the foothills of western Weir Lands, in an unnavigable but beautiful, entrancing series of mild waterfalls that goes on for miles and miles before reaching the rapids of Eelan and then the Mabhakol Falls, just before it flows under the Ring to join the Borda River to form the Pavan.  While the Pavan  sustains a great deal of life in the Fatunika it also brings with it river pirates and other challenges flowing down from the Krunki northlands and the western hills.  As a result  of such traffic the Pavan is almost as heavily patrolled by Fatunik and other Saskantinonian forces as is the Ring Road.

The southern river, the Setta, originates in the hills where the wild western Weir Lands beyond the borders of Saskantinon merge into those of northern Aranzen, a largely huum-run region to the southwest of the Saskan lands.  Legends, tales, traditions, songs and traditional sentiments of the region describe the Setta as the lifeblood of the Bar-speaking regions of Saskantinon, Aranzen and Krbshanana.  Some traditions sing of it as the River-Soul and treat it as an object of veneration and even worship, similar to how the Eelian River is treated by some westerners.  In a demographic and pragmatic sense, the Setta — along with the southern part of the Ring Road, marks the line between the largely huum and huum-appearing populations to the north of the river and the largely animal and mixed animal-huum populations to its south, particularly in the Saskan region of Barbarana, bordering the Realm of the Komikol, and the marshy region of Arq. 

Banks of the Rivers
As they flow through the Ringtoons, the Pavan and the Setta mark both geographic and political divides. Only in the area around Lake of Bye do the same sub-regional language and cultural and economic norms appear on both banks of the Setta.  As with the Ring Road, the two rivers serve as both boundary and transport; they provide a dividing-line as well as a common thread.  

A Ride Down the Pavan

A boat trip on the Pavan would start in one of two places.  Just east of the falls at Markbhol, near the delightful town of Qirol, just inside the Ring, where the Eelian River first expands into a navigable stream, not too long before it joins the Pavan proper. Or to the northwest of the fortified town of Borded, perhaps as far as the border of the Saskan Lands where the waters of the Borda River spill dramatically down from the heights of the Krunkinotto Hills, rushing into the southern plains, where it forms a porous border between the two Rider-dominated regions of mountainous Oknott and the windswept plains Liganalupán.  

The first great architectural site one would see would be Borded, the largest and one of the grandest towns Saskantinon, home of the powerful Riders Guild. The Borda River passes directly past its elaborate walls, passing under the Ring Road at the Paladin Bridge near Borded’s impressive Southern Gate.  A winding and difficult river to navigate, one would still be steering very carefully as the Borda River passes through the hills of southern Sallofol before merging into the more peaceful, if considerably wider, Pavan. 

Continuing eastward, now well into the realm of the Heliocastron, on the right-hand, starboard, southern bank of the Pavan, sailors and their crew and passengers would see first the forests of the Borda Woods and then, after passing the richly appointed militaristic Fatunik town of Sungyte, the rich farmlands of Rutonijal all along the riverbank for miles on end. Such bucolic scenes continue all the way to the grand town of Khaliro, a major Fatunik trading center, and then go on again for many more until reaching the town of Rutónik, where the Ring once again crosses the Pavan as it heads south towards the dense forests of Kahilibarbakal.  

The north, on the left-hand, portside bank of the Pavan, a similar but sparser and starker agricultural vista unfolds for the river-borne voyager traveling past Borded, Sungyte, Khaliro and Rútonik. The province of Jivákala, between the Pavan and the Ring, is home to major Fatunik military encampments. But they are far from the river, not visible to river travelers. What they would see from the boat are villages, farms, small encampments, and vast fields of grain for harvest and forage for beasts — a peaceful scene belying its purpose, which is to feed to Fatune Tagabant, the Dorq Tagabant and the Volunteers — the armed forces of the Heliocastron. 

Passing under the Bridge of Trees just east of Rútonik, voyagers on the river Pavan experience a distinct sense of passage as they move into the borderlands of Eibar.  These Saskan Lands face off  towards the Ilyushan delta to their north and east, feeding into the immense Gray Forest of the Jezidi’ivv River basin and beyond that, the startlingly imposing sentinels of the Ilyushan Peaks, where, it is said, many monsters dwell. On a clear day, an observant traveller who’d thought to bring a looking-glass could see, away to the northeast, the tree line of the Gray Forest where it quickly deepens and darkens as it approaches the north-eastern border of Saskantinon with the Ilyushan Lands, marked by the Jezidi'ivv River.    

After Rútonik, the Pavan widens considerably. Its traffic takes on a considerably busier, more mixed and cosmopolitan character, with traffic arriving from the Krbsh Sea and moving upriver to trade with the Saskantoons. The town of Ingar in the province of Eibar is the last mainland outpost of Saskan civilization a seaborne traveler sees before the Pavan merges with the Jezidi'ivv to pour into the Ilyushan Delta on the northern end of the Krbsh Sea. Assuming a traveller were then to voyage on into the Sea, they’d see the great tower of the Port of Pavanarune, which overlooks the massive Delta, guarding the entry into Saskantinon from the sea. If they continued south, hugging the coast, they might also see the smaller tower of the Port of Selaron in the Outer Ring province of Mobalbesq, and even further to south, they’d encounter the mouth of the Setta, where it separates the Mobalbesq from the Isle of Nye Lands. And here they would have definitively left the northern Eibar-speaking lands, characterized politically by collaboration between the Riders Guild and the Heliops, both organizations run by and for the benefit of huum-appearing-huum, and entered the Arq-speaking Saskan lands, where things are a bit different.

A Ride Down the Setta

Our traveller who had set out from the Krunkinotto borderlands north of Borded, if they had survived all the way to Selaron and beyond, might very well encounter a traveler who had also begun a river journey far to the west, but further to the south.

The Weir Lands cross over the border of Saskantinon into the Lands of the Aranzen people — a fuzzy border. The border between the Krunkinotto — itself a vague concept — and the Weir Lands is also not entirely clear.  What is well-known is that the town of Low Weir (or Freedom.. or.. ?) is nestled in the foothills of the southern Weir Lands, just north of the border — such as it is — with Aranzen. One may book passage there for a ship on the Setta.  

Unlike the enchanting rolling rocks of the Eelian River, the Setta is navigable starting from a point just west of (Low Weir). It gathers water from innumerable small streams as it makes its way through the Aranzen Hills. This part of the voyage is a delight.  For a reasonable amount of aybets, a player can book a “cruise” through these parts just for pleasure. 

Business gets underway when the Setta passes directly through the town of Barbol, which sits on the Ring as it turns from South to East.  On the northern, left-hand, port-side of the river, just past Barbol, are the southern end of the Borda Woods, an important part of the Fatunik heartland.  On a clear day, the Sunny banners and flags of a sizable Fatunik military encampment are visible from the river . On the right-hand, starboard, southern side of the Setta, north of the Ring, is the province of Settanarune. It is the southern equivalent of Rontonabloo (or maybe just Rutonijal?), a rich agricultural region densely populated with villages, farms and settlements. 

Midway to Lake of Bye, the river passes by the town of Brokilly. It sits on the northern side of the river and watches over a minor road that joins the Ring to center of Fatunik civilization:  the province of Tobaloon, a region of immense fir and pine trees, where the Fatunik Offices reside and the great town of Beshquohoek is located at the geographic center of Saskantinon. Brokilly itself, however, is in the province of Kahilabequa, a place inhabited mostly by Kahila folk, that has been devastated more than once by conflict between the Sunny forces and those of various uprisings and rebellions. At present, it is peaceful thanks to a kind of order imposed by the romperi guilds, who find that they can conduct their “business” more effectively when there is something like a “free” territory, that is not perpetually at war, in which they can operate more or less unmolested. 

Many travelers along the Setta visit the southern side of the river to get a sense of or to dig into to rich traditions of the Settany culture.  They visit the northern side, in the Kahila lands, there mostly for, ummm, shopping. 

It might seem strange to some that a territory with a reputation for being rebel-held borders so closely to the very seat of Fatunik power.  How this holds together is not so strange when one visits the Tagabant Toon of Brytook, just up the road from Brokilly, or when one sees the Fatunik military encampments all along the roads from Brytook to Beshquohuk.  The Tobaloon/Kahilabequa borderlands are heavily fortified on the Fatunik side.

A river voyager might be justified in feeling a bit tense as they travel further along by Kahilabequa province to the north, and passing along into the more remote eastern part of Settany to the south. Things appear a good bit wilder on both sides of the river as one passes further away from Brokilly.  Most folks know that the wild and woolly Barbarana Lands are just a bit further to the south, outside of the Ring, and beyond that are the Bay of Bar and the Realm of the Komikol, places that are nearly synonymous with “the ends of the earth” for many players, who often are just barely aware of the vast geography of Lurabar, much less what lies beyond the Seas.

Trepidations come to an abrupt end when a boat floating east on the Setta passes under the Sobright Bridge into the Land of the Great Toon of Byenung, in the Runes of Bye. Here the river widens considerably and the land on both sides of the river erupts into activity, with unusual and entertaining sites to amuse and delight anyone who is not averse to a culture and economy dominated by folks whose DNA is beaverish.  The vast majority of Byerunics are mixed sentients. They appear similar to huum, with only some exhibiting more dramatically beaver-like physical semblances such as large flat tails. Many echo the large sometime even black and wet nose, the small mouth and small eyes of their Catoridae ancestors, but on a distinctly huum frame. However, their language, culture, economy and architecture is entirely distinct from other regions of the Saskan Lands. 

The town of Byenung is, along with Borded and Beaquohuk, one of the three Grand Toons of the region. Like the others, it could almost be considered a city. [Come up with a vocabulary for villages, towns, cities, farms, ranches, encampments, fortified towns, and so on that reflects the varied nature of rural life especially.]  It is certainly the most unusual of the three. A traveller on the Setta first sees the extraordinarily tall and elaborate walls and towers and artworks of Byenung off to south, but may be forgiven for not taking notice ,since they would soon be encountering the impressive engineering feat of the Locks of Lake of Bye, a series of canals leading into the Great Lake of Bye. 

First time visitors might think they had reached the Krbsh Sea rather than a lake.  It is that vast. Following along the shoreline a visitor experiences the rare joy of seeing Byenung from the water. The city simply merges into the Lake. There is no discernible shoreline. Buildings, commerce, shipping, livelihood and everyday life dissolve together into the water’s edge, in bewildering maze of canals, waterways, buildings on stilts, small dam-like structures, water-craft of all kinds, and the infrastructure continue under the water for some distance into the Great Lake.    

A voyager can navigate their boat through the city, onto the southbound canal, that stretches for many miles all the way to the Port of Barqton in the remote and boggy swampland of Arq, on the Bay of Bar, across the canal from the easternmost reaches of Barbarana province. A voyager taking this route would be a brave adventurer indeed, heading towards the mysterious southern lands of Krbshanana or Komikol. Perhaps even an off-lander looking to escape the Enclosure and travel to the fabled continent of Bricot and beyond!

More likely, they would continue east across the Lake of Bye. Either to the Nye Lands Canal, which leads into the marshy Arql Sea and thence, through the Marshlands, to the Krbsh Sea, or through the Eastern Locks and Great Beaver Dam, continuing down the Setta, winding their way past the Isle of Nye Lands to the south and Mobalbesq to the north, both areas devoted largely to sea-related trade and supporting a widely mixed population. 

The Mobalbesqua town of Morilly, still a good ways from the Sea, but remarkably close via road to that other rebel province — the densely wooded Kahila-folk land of Kahilibarbakal — is a common stopping-off point for loading up or off-loading goods and supplies for transport around the point, past Selador and Ríkila, typically for trading with Arq-speaking lands, or even into the Eastern Lands… should one be foolish enough to want to deal with the inhabitants of the Forgh, or to pass through the swamps and mountains of the Ilyushan. 

Some old ballads claim that it is possible to take a boat up one of the river ways of the Forg, and navigate through them to the Sea of Song, and from thence to other civilized lands of Luramar. Have we yet met a player who has actually done so?  Well-informed Agents think not.

            <Title>The Fallen Riders</Title>
            <Text> A heavily armed squad of Beshquo day watchers called, only during the time of the Gleaming, the First Day’s Watch, accompanied them every step of the way. The loyal protectors directed their leading examples, Iohane and Henqu, along with eleven other accused to the site of the blaze. In loosely enveloping robes woven from the rough wool of Salotrizan mammoth goatfons, ankles and wrists enchained, the prisoners were marched slowly from their dark dank cells, out into the winding alleyways of the Beshquohuk bazaar at the heat of mid-day. 

For the Gleaming, the loyal protectors of the righteous wore rare and expensive armor made from multiple layers of shells of giant Borda arns.  Henqu hadn’t had a good bucket of s’lah in days and needed something to keep himself amused. He considered how the peculiar all-black armor made the day watch contingent look like big awkward bugs. 

Whispering “creepy-crawly bugs” a few times under his breath, he smiled. Though few might recognize that slight fluctuation in his typically stern grimace as amusement, Iohane picked up on it.

The mid-morning sun was approaching its high point, exciting the crowd.  The faithful had traveled to the capital from far and wide for the high holy days. From the fertile fields of Rotannablue, from the deep woods of Borda and from the bloody plains of Jivákala, and beyond.  The prisoners heard the crowd’s babble bubbling up from the center of town, gearing up for the rituals.  A hub-bub of excitement. Rhythmic shouting and chanting as they drew nearer.  

Iohane and Henqu had seen Gleamings before.  They’d both been raised in Fatunik broods prior to joining the community of Riders. They knew what was going on. They knew what to expect.  

At this point, a professional agitator from the Heliocastron performs on the great round dias in the center of town, a symbolic representation of the Great Deep Pool in Juuj. The official speechifying, detailing their crimes and the reasons for their punishment, goes on and on, riling up the faithful. Still pouring in from the rural villages of Tobaloon and Borda, the first-timers stare in awe at the monumental architecture and statuary of the Fatunik capital. 

Pure and Ordained Cacographers of the Center practice their trade on every street-corner, chanting the age-old diatribes and slogans, their faces towards the Sun, slowly beating their shoulders and backs with stalks of the giant red spurge, a sun- and heat-loving plant, whose small bright yellow blooms on a dark velvety red background form the core symbology of the First Day.

Iohane surreptitiously scanned the low rooftops for signs of rescuers. Their hopes were not high. 

A last-minute appeal, much less any active interference from the Riders was unlikely.  A public condemnation from the High Council in Borded for having made their relationship known had not helped things. Nor had Henqu’s failure to disclose his “unnatural” powers of persuasion. Their less-than-heroic reputation among the Kahila bands and other rebel types meant that any action on their behalf from a starry quarter was unlikely too, despite Henqu’s quasi-heroic reputation in Ríkila.

But. 

Early that morning they’d found a message in their cell. Scribbled on a tiny piece of leathered jackskin in a script used by those who’d been initiated into the prison life of Beet, and in a dialect of Eibarq unique to the camps of Beet and Mixry, it simply read, “Have no fear. Help is near”.

The prisoners march turned a corner onto a slightly less-narrow street, moving closer to the broad avenues of the town center.  Curious townsfolk and visitors lined the way. Jazzed up by Cacographers’ assurance that the burning of sinners would cleanse their own souls. Anticipating the day’s entertainment.  They stared at the examples. Some made rude gestures. When the tall and imposing Riders at the lead of the group of prisoners came close to them, more than a few took a step back.  

One worked-up and ancient loyalist stepped forward, though, spit on the ground as the Riders passed and shouted, “Burn for your sins, animal-loving heretics!”

Henqu looked the old codger in the eye. And winked. 

Then he bolted forward as if to attack, straining against his chains.  The befuddled heckler fell back onto his bum-side with a crude oath. The Watch pushed Henqu back with their fancy ceremonial basher sticks. Which had been manufactured by and purchased from, Henqu realized, from the Rider’s Armory in Givakal. 

He laughed loudly.

And started singing.

It was a bit from the obbligato at the conclusion of the tragic “Song of the Lost Miners”, a sad northwestern ballad popular with members of the Bordali Mining Cooperative. Most often sung as a dirge following deaths due to accidents. A long and convoluted tale, its leitmotif revolves around the sneakiness and perfidy of the Mistral Tower of Empafarasi, a commonly-held prejudice held by the miners of Eelan and Oknott.

In a loud, clear, ringing Eibar that echoed through the narrow streets, the celebrated singing “Rider You Can Trust”, as he was called in at least a few of the less reputable pubs in Ríkila, put on a show for his Fatunik captors and the crowd, intoning in a fine deep baritone:

“They were dead on arrival,
 The Royal post had never come,
 In a hole in the mountain,
 To the sound of the drums,
 They went through the motions,
 That lost miners know,
 In turn,
 In vain,
 They let go.
 They let go.”

“Shut your tooky hole, you star-spun heretic,” a junior member of the Fatune Tagabant barked at Henqu. Having bravely put down the disgraced Rider, the young guard looked around with a grin for the approval of his mates. Who seemed to be ignoring him.

Listening to the confusing murmurs arising among the townfolk following the young guard’s rebuke, Iohane understood in a flash then that Henqu had just done something entirely unusual for a Gleaming. He’d taken it lightly. He was mocking them. Refused to show either contrition or fear. It had confused the watchers and the crowd.

The imposing Rider tossed her head back, throwing off the itchy cowl. 

Glaring at the junior with all the fierceness that a hardscrabble upbringing on the Norgyte frontier instills she shouted at the junior loud enough so that everybody on the street could hear,  “Let him sing his song, you measly excuse of a Guard-fart! The Sun must’ve been behind clouds the day you were born! The Rider Henqu is twice the warrior you will ever be, you scrawny pipsqueak of a shit-stained ratfon!”

“Let him sing!!”

Taken aback by Iohane’s ferocity, the senior Fatune Tagabant again hesitated before moving to push her back and pull the cowl back over her head. They further stalled their blows when cries erupted among folks in the crowd, startling them,

“Let him sing! Let him sing!”

Not missing a beat, Henqu launched into a rendition of a rather silly tune recently made quite popular throughout the northern and eastern lands by Birakay, the popular performer from Qurol. Derived from a rather raunchy “riding song” of the Kahilakol Song Cycle, Birakay had dialed it down to make it acceptable in the more open-minded hosteleries and inns of Qurol, Sungyte and the other more cosmopolitan Fatunik venues close to the Ring. 

It was the kind of song young Heliopter could sing and feel a bit rebellious. But without immediately incurring the condemnation of a Lawful Scribe and creating possible troubles with the Authority.  

It even had one line sung, rather shockingly for a Fatunik audience, in Damemq.  Iohane joined in with Henqu on the chorus.

“Oh, we are rough and ready riders,
 We love to drink our cider.
 Hey, listen to my Damemq
 As we ride through the stardark

 From time to time!
 From sea to sea! 

 Don’t get in our way!
 Or soon you all will pay.
 Go to it! Face the music!
 Don’t be stupid! Fire away!

 From time to time!
 From sea to sea!”

It was a clear provocation.  While many in the crowd were laughing and a good number of younger folks lining the way had started singing along, most were furious.  

The song ended as the First Fatune Tagabant, having recovered their composure, rained blows down on the excommunicated Riders. A bit of mayhem rippled through the crowd as people shouted and yelled and those further back pushed forward to find out what had happened.

Conveyances

The Jaxen developed a machinic sloebeest. Some were captured by Empafarasi forces and are used to haul some materials. Solar-powered, the machine sloebeests must sunbathe for an extended period of time between uses. The means to control them is a closely-guarded secret. 

The Empafarasi rent out machinic sloebeests, along with operators, to the Eelani, mostly for use hauling raw materials from mines to forges.
Goal


Physical Description
Giant non-sentient or only very barely sentient sloths typically engaged to pull large-sized vehicles or caravan-busses. Very slow-moving but reliable and gentle.

Vegetarian, and while they eat a lot, it is not unmanageable.  Due to their very slow metabolism, a little goes a long way.  Sloebeest excrement is collected for fuel.

Kam and Qu'rub are invited to Ingar to help inaugurate the traditionalists' new Temple there. Giltraq meets various delegates (see Humor below), each introducing a special kind of tension.
&gt; &lt;  Main events, resolutions, actions in this scene.

Kam and Qu'rub are elected worker-representatives to the New Fatunik Council, created by the Reformed Scribes of Beshquohuk, against the opposition of Giltraq, who has emerged from the fighting as 'The Defender of Eibar' and who espouses a traditional Fatunik perspective. 

Giltraq declares that he is not a Lohrnite, but looks for a reconciliation with them and an amnesty for them. He defends Tonedo's legacy (did Tonedo get killed? Maybe in combat with, or when fleeing from, the Ilyushan?), while agreeing with some of the critiques of the Reformed Scribes. Declares that all issues have been resolved and calls on the faithful to keep to traditions like the Gleaming.

Lohrn is smuggled into Ingar, where he is kept under close guard. There is a secret meeting with Giltraq, where they discuss the "problem" of Stanley and Birakay.

Finish --&gt;  One of the characters  introduced to Giltraq is Ramona in disguise. Has she left the Sisters and is on a trail of revenge? Is she seeking to influence Giltraq in a fresh direction?

 Timeline

Six months after Card 38.
Beauty

Joy, pleasure and fulfillment are available in unlimited supply in our inner spaces. Show the songs returning, in a fresh cycle, within their various and varied locales, as the new and the traditional ways mingle, and a renewed spirit arises.
Humor

See Act II, Scene I, of Love's Labor's Lost, verses 35-80 and 180-250, introducing various characters to the king,  Use this as a kind of template for Giltraq being introduced to people as he tries to understand the lay of the land. 
Truth

Nothing is really settled. The dialectic continues to unfold as the fractal patterns realign.  Will a new bourgeoisie emerge from within the Party? Stay tuned, comrades... 

Impact

A feeling of resolution and peace calms the readers' spirits. But there is an underlying sense of unease, of new plots afoot. There are more epics to come...

Kirill bets it all on a sea voyage. The odd critters and the sea.

Waleran's runners let Showan and B'arqo know about Tonedo's plans for Birakay.  Showan  sacrifices his attraction to / desire to stay with Birakay for a greater reward -- preventing the assassination of Birakay and stopping the persecution of Stanley.

Gallex tempts Showan to go on the sea voyage but he foregoes it, choosing to try to rescue SPQ and save Birakay instead.  

&gt; &lt;  Main events, resolutions, actions in this scene.

Everyone gets into deeper waters.

Grim Malek (may want to merge this character with Gallex?) and Luvcando vie for captaincy of the vessel (which is named...), end up agreeing to work together. Kirill is suspicious of them. There are strange shadows and movements on the ship. Their destination is unclear. East. Towards the Remari Islands. Beyond the realm of the Delphine. All according to Kirill, who is being guided by the Seffs (octo-sints). 

Tonedo's plot against Birakay unfolds.

B'arqo has it out with the Night Hall, telling its council members that they need set aside their differences and petty squabbles and come together to play an important role is saving the Lands and transforming the political situation once and for all. 

Birakay decides to tour the Southern provinces without asking permission from the Center.

Finish --&gt;  Showan departs for Beshquohuk. His official role is to present the Byenung Argument. Unofficially, he hopes to coordinate with MM and others to free SPQ. Ramona goes with him.

Timeline

Action --&gt; Following from chapter 7 and chapter 11.  Work on the continuity of Tonedo's decision to take out Birakay. (That probably needs to move to chapter 11.) 
Beauty

Passing beyond "the edge of the world" opens the doors of perception.
Humor

The rivalry and comradeship amongst members of the Night Hall is also like the tossing of the waves.
Truth

One can act bravely even when frightened. Courage does not mean no fear.  
Impact

Psychological. Complex motivations can be captivating. Lots of feels in this chapter. Bring the pain of the sea voyage too: seasickness, sunburn, eye strain, rope burns, fish bites, broken bones, heart attack/stroke, poisoning, as well as the madness of "falling off the edge" and "going beyond".

(A little nod to stories about Lao Zi.)

Showan debates fine points of the Law in preparation for presenting the Byeling Arguments to the Elders at the Deep Pool in Juuj. 

Birakay encounters enticements and criticisms during performances throughout the Outer Lands.

Flashback: Azron Gurk discourages Stanley from learning about flying.

&gt; &lt;  Main events, resolutions, actions in this scene.

This chapter focuses on Showan and Birakay. And through them, flashbacks to Quinn's background and childhood.


As our team travels the seaways and roads to Byenung and Wye, rumors swirl about events at the Authority, the Byenung intellectual-legal community is an uproar over the arrest of Quinn, Henqu and Iohane, and the Mobal Beshqi mobilize their own Argumentation team to defend the New Thoughts. 

Showan debates fine points of the Law in preparation for presenting the Byeling Arguments to the Elders at the Deep Pool in Juuj.  

Birakay, through ongoing performances and interactions with fans throughout the Outer Lands, foreshadows stories that will be wrapping up or presented as cliff-hangers in chapter 10 of Act One. 


These tales reveal aspects of the archetypal selves of Showan, Birakay and Stanley:
- The mask - how they present themselves to the world
- The shadow - their sexual and other instincts
- The anima - the feminine aspects of their character
- The self - cohesion of conscious and unconscious, complete, rounded "mandala" selfness
- Of the other other 12 standard archetypal images, they each tend towards...

Showan: sage, ruler, caregiver
Birakay: creator, jester, lover
Stanley Quinn: explorer, rebel, hero


Nobody and nothing flies in the Saskan Lands. Azron Gurk, a wizardly-character, intervened to prevent SPQ from thinking too much about flight, creating a mystery about who that character is --while literally bringing Icarus down to earth.  


Finish - As the tales wind down, Jax Remanj, the waiter from the first chapter, acts up, throwing a kind of zen wrench into the idea that we thought we understood everything.  So this chapter ends on a discordant  tritone. Not a recognizable song cycle. 
Timeline

Action --&gt; Following directly from chapter 8, with a big flashback to SPQ's earlier life, which explains the arrival of Stan and Ramona in the Mobalbesq.
Beauty

The inevitability of a love triangle emerges, making the reader feel like they've figured out a key part of the story. Then Jax Remanj comes into it and surprise! The mystery (regarding romance) deepens.
Humor

The busy-body-ness of Byenung betrays the beaverific nature of its boroughs. 
Truth

One shouldn't run away from a true ruler. 
Impact

It would be a great torment for any of the boys to lay aside the one they care for the most. Yet each of them must do so in order to complete their journey.

Indeterminate • Here and There, Hither and Yon

Role in Story

Deus-ex-machina, literally. 

A fallen god. A devil. An angel. 

One of the main narrators of the epic, in the form of reports to "Control".
Goal
Likes to fix things that are getting wildly out of tune. A cosmic piano repair man.
A voice for expressing some of the philosophical points outlined in the Notes.
Physical Description
Old man with wild hair. Dresses for the road because he is often traveling or going to obscure places. Carries a number of tools on his person, usually concealed under an overcoat. 

Personality
Diffident but funny.  Aloof but compassionate. 

Occupation
Is a field operative for the Agency with responsibility for both information gathering and occasional interventions.

Habits/Mannerisms
Loves the Saskantinonians, but has been instructed not to get too close to them.  His life-span exceeds most of theirs by many generations. Has been trained that it is best not to get too attached to any one in particular. Nevertheless, he often falls in love or develops strong feelings and has had multiple affairs over the years with both men and women, both beklek, mixten and sint.  His own physical form is the result of Agency engineering. Even Azron has a hard time remembering what his original form was.

Background
Was a robotics/implants repair man on his home planet, which had 18 genders, 12 of which had to interact for new life to germinate. Specialized in ocular and aural enhancing devices. Kind of a cosmic optometrist and hearing-aide specialist. Has a universal translator device.
Internal Conflicts
Sometimes misses his home planet, which was destroyed due to internal conflicts and pollution and was not enclosed in time to save it. Often thinks he should have stayed with the survivors who had left for a nearby planet on a kind of high-tech life-boat, rather than accepting the offer of employment from the Agency. Appreciates the efforts of the Agency to direct the people of this planet in a more sustainable directions. But worries on philosophical/ethical grounds that they are interfering too much.

External Conflicts
Does not get along well with his boss, who is a middle-management dullard. Azron often gets criticized for his tendency to go off script when in the field.

            <Text>Cereb
Newborn • Wing Island

Role in Story
Re-introduces the reality of flight into the cultural context of the Saskan Lands.

Through flight and internal narrative, get a different perspective on things and help to tie things together, while (re-)introducing a "lost" element of reality in the Enclosure. 

The birth of Cereb should read and proceed as a challenge to the Agency's supremacy -- as the beginning of the opening of the Enclosure.  We end the story with Cereb breaking free of the Enclosure in a sense, the final failure of the Agents to prevent flight from returning to the Saskan Lands.

Goal
Don't entirely steal the mother of dragons motif.  In this case Cereb is her/him/itself a sentient being -- but unlike most of the characters is more animal in appearance than huum.

Physical Description
Much on the bird side. Does not look or act like a dragon except perhaps in some allusions to the mythical phoenix.

            <Text>On the side of a Mount Eelan, its imposing eastern cliffs visible equally from Eelan Toon and Low Weir (Lavega), not all that far from the Ring Road, marking the line where the Great Wall of Fire subsided centuries ago, an enormous portal slowly slides open. 

Displacing rock, dirt, trees and shrub, a small avalanche of debris cascades downward as the giant doors, their movement driven by some unknown internal mechanism that — given the size of the doors — itself must be on a scale nearly unthinkable in most of Saskantinon. The grinding and screeching of the mechanism echoes through the hills, sending animals scurrying and causing sints far and wide to look towards Eelan in wonder. 

As the terrible sound screeches to a halt, travelers on the Eelan Road stop and stare, at a huge cloth-covered wagon emerging from the side of the mountain. It moves smoothly, in an unworldly fashion, more like a ship than a wagon.  And making no sound at all. 

Into the air.

Drifting out of the side of hill like a cloud. The size of an enormous boat of the type that could only be sailed on Great Lake of Bye, or one of the Southern Seas. 

The … thing … drifts straight out from the side of the hill, not falling, not rambling down the side of the incline as a wagon would. A cabin of sorts hangs from below it, and there is smoke coming from it, and the dancing lick of fire. 

When the enormous wagon clears the mountainside, it drifts upwards towards the clouds. On its sides, carefully embroidered into the sails, visible for dozens of kicks in every direction: the Royal Seal of the Lords of High Weir (which is…?).  

“It’s the Empafarasi!”, a traveler gasps, pointing up at the sky. 

“They’re real!” 

From the peak of Mount Eelan, a shadow moves. Something odd. Moving around in the air like smoke or ash from a fire. Some things!… are soaring high above.  In the air! Like a kite. But moving determinedly, in a steady direction.  And not just one.  Not just several. Are you seeing that!?  A flotilla of gliding things.

Those with far-reaching eyesight could discern that each of the flying vessels was carrying a sint of some kind.  And they were making a subtle roar. 


Azron Gurk began to record what he was seeing, whispering furiously into his recording device: “Tuke Forsake Me! Blast-it-all! They’ve tuking done it. Notify Planning immediately! And schedule me for a pick-up.  We’re going to need to re-evaluate everything. Tuke-in-Ganymede and throw me in a black hole!! They’ve figured out flight.  And right under our noses too. Collapsing Galaxies!”

I liked how Game of Thrones had a pretty detailed perspective on "the seven" god-like figures. Maybe could play with something like that using the 12 standard Jungian archtetypes? ...
Ruler
Creator/artist
Sage
Innocent
Explorer
Rebel
Hero
Wizard
Jester
Everyman
Lover
Caregiver

At one point I'd used elements of Tarot and Qabalah to name the months on some calendars. Maybe these would serve better for names on calendars that have 12 months.


MAJOR CALENDARS

The Agency uses 3 closely-related versions of an astronomical calendar suitable for translation between the other ones.

Fatunik Solar standard for time-keeping and calendaring that is used or at least understood by most actors.  Two versions, the older Juuj and the Reformed Beshquoan

Very similar solar calendars used in The Runes of Bye, the Nye Lands and Mobalbesq. Close to the Fatunik Calendar but with different ways of handling leap-months, leap-years.

Southern/Settan/Sogomsh Lunar calendars.

Many non-astronomical arithmetic calendars used by various sint tribes, cultures, traditions. 

The Terrapin Calendar covers an epoch starting 360,000 years ago. 

The Revolutionary Jacks Calendar cycles through 72 days (three lunar cycles, basically one season) and has little organized sense of years.

Kahila helio-lunar calendar.

Empafarasi/Eelan calendar based on movement of planets, plus solar and lunar.

For the sake of getting started, let's map out the calendars in a spreadsheet, then later adjust for details.

 SOLAR / HELIOPTIC

The original series of months I came up with for the Heliops was derived from the the tarot deck and the Kabbalah/tree of life. Let's make that more unique to the inherent qualities of the story/game.  I don't mind at all mixing/matching from mystical and religious traditions, but don't want a direct steal unless it is for a very particular joke or purposeful reference. 

Here was the original version, with the tarot and Kabbalah references... and some possible alternatives....

Keddar / The Crown		Cheddar
Jokma / The King		The Joker, The Clown
Beana / The Cup
Jexa / Mother of Mercy	(kind of like this one as is)
G'boor / The Book		The Argument
Tifara / The Sword
Netzchad / Victory
Had / The Eternal
Yessad / The Foundation	Azimov
Malkad / The Kingdom
Aelfad / The Fool
Beesad / The Mage

Use a rhyming dictionary to come up with more unique words.
See the Calendar_Calcs spreadsheet. It has much better names for the Fatunik months, etc.

The book Calendrical Algorithms describes all major calendars. Might be better to steal from that, or at least to get some ideas.

UNIVERSAL

The Agency’s understanding of time would be considerably different from inside the Enclosure.  That is where sci-fi / space fiction considerations need to come into play, especially regarding relativity, near-light-speed travel and/or traveling vast distances thru space. 

But don’t get TOO carried away with complex physics; it’s not really the realm of this story and the intention is for the Agency to be not all there any way. The astronomical calendar they use is adapted to the local star system. There is yet another truly "Universal" calendar they use, but that gets us into a different game that I don't intend to represent this time around, involving reincarnation, heavens, hells, time manifolds and so on.

SOLAR vs. LUNAR

The world has two moons. Given the important role that solar vs lunar understanding plays, there are of course both solar calendar (Fatunik, Rider, Outer Lands), lunar calendars that relate to one or both Moons, and helio-lunar (Kahila) ones that try to accomodate both. 

Need to work out the most basic astronomy for this planet, including the seasons/weather patterns for Saskantinon. Make sure the solar and lunar calendars align to it.  What is the length of the actual solar year? Of the lunar revolutions?

May be able to use some software to compute/estimate some of that.


TIDES

There are three main seas involved in the geography of the region, two Great Lakes, one of which is tied to a large salt marsh that connects to the ocean and thus is referred to as a Sea, and several rivers that empty into the seas/ocean.  Some clear sense of tidal events and river flooding patterns will be good to have.

This should also influence the design of some calendars.


MINOR CALENDARS and VARIATIONS

Some of the secret societies, quasi-religious groups, sint communities, as well as particular clans/tribes, may have additional variations, especially with respect to observations of important days and such.


SEASONS, DAYS, WEEKS, HOURS

Day-names, how day-divisions/hours/minutes are named and handled, understanding of leap-years, season, solstices/equinoxes and possibly some stellar events should all be understood for any calendar (which is most of them) that is not 100% arithmetic.

It will also be important to note, for each calendar, when a day begins -- Noon? Midnight? Sunrise? Sunset? Other?  And of course... Noon, etc...  Where?  

How big are the Saskan Lands?  Do folks in the East experience Noon simultaneously with folks in the West?  How much of a time difference is there?  Who decides what time it is in any particular locale?

As far as time-measures under 1 day, this can also vary from place to place, in different provinces, cultures, etc. But we should expect that the Fatunik Standard is the most widespread and commonly used.  Astronomical time can use decimal expressions (some other calendars may do this also) and thus has no need, really, for other kinds of time-keeping.

Some terms I expect to be part of the Fatunik "canon"...

	•	1 wayt = 5 minutes
	•	1 watch = 3 hours = 36 wayts
	•	1 stand = 3 hours = 36 wayts
	•	1 bell = 1.5 hours = 18 wayts

	•	First watch ~~ 3 hours starting at sunset (about 18h - 21h)
	•	Second watch ~~ 3 hours prior to midnight (about 21h - 0h)
	•	Third watch ~~ 3 hours after midnight  (about 0h - 3h)
	•	Fourth watch ~~ 3 hours prior to sunrise (about 3h - 6h)

	•	First stand ~~ 3 hours after sunrise (about 6h - 9h)
	•	Second stand ~~ 3 hours prior to noon (about 9h - 12h)
	•	Third stand ~~ 3 hours after noon (about 12h - 15h)
	•	Fourth stand ~~ 3 hours prior to sunset (about 15h - 18h)

+ / -  Main conflicts in this scene.

Birakay is found in contempt for interrupting the Argument. [Make sure we've shown this previously... If not, do it here.] He is taken away for imprisonment, expecting execution at the next Gleaming.

Another intervention by Monmar Massachawa, with help from Ramona and B'arqo, just barely enable his escape. There is injury. Possibly loss of life. Tonedo orders the immediate execution of Birakay and banning of his songs.

When SPQ is found to be in error, Showan picks up the argument on behalf of the Byenung delegation.

Tonedo sends out "polite" orders to suppress the dispersal of pollinators, eliminate any birds, bees and bugs, to end the singing of the New Song / practice of the New Forms, and to occupy Mobalbesq. He is clearly beginning to waver a bit, even though his actions are dire. One of his lieutenants, Lorhn (see his bio), starts to send out orders much more strongly worded, indicating a "far-right" split in the forces around the Center.
&gt; &lt;  Main events, resolutions, actions in this scene.

A delegation of Freeborn Riders of the Eelani, along with some of their allies from the western and southern lands, ride to Borded and announce their separation from the Riders Council.  Otto Trucent announces he will join them and leads a force of rebel Riders south towards Eelan, carrying the personal sigils of Iohane and Henqu as their banner, to join up with them.

The Riders Council receives messages from the Empafarasi that they too will join with the Eelani but 
that there has been uprising of the bad machines, aimed at huum, sint and dissident Jaxen, launched from the Krunkinotto, into Empafarasi territory.  The forces gathered near Eelan Toon head to the northwest to assist the Empafarasi.

Word of the machine assault spreads like wildfire. Many Jaxen abandon their posts; those who remain are widely suspected of being enemy agents. The friends of Jax Remanj worry for the safety of his pod and for other dissident Jaxen. A pogrom within the pogrom emerges; it is not only Heliops who have been infected with the Fear. 

Barbarian gangs and nomads sweep into Oknott and Norgyte from the Wesshewen plains. We’ve heard about them over and over. (Have we? Where?) Always in a heroic context of protecting the Lands. They head South en masse to take advantage of the difficult times.  The Riders Council calls on all loyal Riders to mobilize to face this threat. They send an appeal to the Authority as well, carefully pointing out that the barbarians are bigger threat than the Kahila and the rebel Outlanders.

Two Trees is overrun as the Ilyushan launch their biggest attack yet. Hádika and Big Tree are threatened, possibly even Ingar. Just as seaborne allies sent by the Delphine Queen begin to arrive in the Bay of Ingar, slithering creatures allied with the Ilyushan begin pouring into the Krsbsh Sea from the Forgh, creating a massive splashy battle there.

(Need to consider -- as usual -- the PoV for describing all of these events.  Agents reports probably, but try to not let it become too much of a one-note perspective.)

Some big radio. Core political problems and contradictions come to a boiling point, expressed in Showan's Arguments with Tonedo's representatives, and in the shadowy machinations around them carried out between factions of the Agency. Are the dissidents harming the Lands, weakening its defenses against multiple serious threats?   Is the Center condemning the Lands to death by ignoring SPQ's argument and stopping the spread of natural pollinators?  Has the Agency lost control of its ability to influence the direction of evolution on Gavor?  

Finish --&gt; A significant astronomical event occurs.  And an earth tremor. And a vast shadow and mysterious wind storm (fore...ummm...shadowing the great bird...)

 Timeline

Action --&gt; Picking up from the end of Act II. A sweeping view of fairly catastrophic events, anchored around the ongoing Argument in Beshquohuk.    
Beauty

Birakay and Showan put their lives on the line to defend their friend. Remanj Jaxen's friends rally around the beneficial machines, taking on a world of condemnation to defend them.
Humor

Poke a little serious fun at Political Correctness in the language used by the Center to condemn the Kahila and Mobalbesq, using phrases along the lines of "enhanced interrogation techniques". 
Truth

There is always a Goebbels for every Hitler, a Bannon for every Trump.  
Impact

Horrifying despair and anxiety. Everything is under attack. All of our heroes and anti-heroes are facing dire, possibly life-threatening circumstances and their wonderful plans are being wrecked.

            <Text>Flashback and Argument


==== Flashback ====

The introduction of Mikel Moballeq foreshadows a long rise near the conclusion of this act.

The Mobalbesq is the most sea-oriented of the Saskan Lands. They are fisher-folk and explorers. They are skeptical when it comes to known facts regarding the edge of the world. largely huum, and the homeland of a variant version of Fatunik belief-systems, but they are not antagonistic towards sints and southerners. 

They are a type of Anarcho-communist Democracy 3.0 society-in-embryo.

Along with Mikel’s story (see his bio), this section develops the relationship of SPQ, Showan Biver-Wing and Birakay by showing some of its background. 

Show how SPQ’s engineering work was supported by, encouraged by the Mobalbesq leaders, among others. 

Hmm... So what actually happens in this flashback? And who is telling the story here?


==== Argument ====

Pick up the central story-line depicting The Great Argument,  like a trial organized by the Heliops to condemn SPQ’s investigations into  pollination, on the basis that they will lead to spreading the heretical beliefs regarding flight. 

The martyrdom of Henqu and Iohane made for a dramatic opening, but even that is in the context of the fundamental challenge to Fatunik orthodoxy presented by SPQ’s findings on how to save all beks -- huum and sint alike -- from annihilation. 


Another layer, a good twist hopefully, is where we find that the an influential Agency Vice-Regent Bud Starga backs the Fatunik side because SPQ’s work will inevitably also eventually uncover the true nature of the Enclosure. ("Bud" is a title, a bit like "comrade", not a name. Starga is female, or at least female-appearing. Introduce other Agents using the same title.)


This could be an entirely separate chapter. If it is going to be combined with flashback, they need to inter-relate in some important way. Like some aspects of the argument reflecting stuff taught by Mikel M, or ideas originated by Showan or Birakay. 

It would help to tie some things together if Stanley's argument included some flavor of the kinds of things that Waleran presented to the Empafarasi. In other words, not only on the science of reclaiming argiculture by embracing the heavens/the glorious sky, but also instituting social organization more like that of the Mobalbesq throughout the lands.

            <Text>Glossary

The name of the Sun is Fatune.  
The names of the Moons are Endor and Sella.
The planet-world (for those who get it) or the known-world + ocean (for those with more limited knowledge) is called Gavor.
The continent that contains the Saskan Lands is called Lurabar.
The world-ocean is called Havorra.

Work these terms into the narrative. Avoid using "Sun", "Moon" or "Earth".


Alfer, Alferine - a militant animalist, or referring to such organizations. An animal-sint militant. Many factions exist. Could be anything from a violent anti-huum revolutionary to a pacifist sint-rights advocate. Don't like this term. Playing with "Untamed" instead, though it is probably (?) too derivative from Game of Thrones "unsullied", I like it.

Aybet -- the smallest unit of currency. See Notes:Structures:Economics

Barqy, Barqier, Barqiest, etc. -- Relating to the use of barq languages and dialects associated with sints. Used in a general sense to refer to things, places, events and so on that have a significant or noticeably non-huum or mixed humm/sint character. 

Barseff -- A Seff employed as a barkeeper in an Inn, a typical occupation for land-bound male Seffs.

Basherbazooki, Basherbazh -- a mercenary, often employed in peacetime as a hunter, bouncer, or protector. Often of a hefty sint variety, most typically involving bovine (bos) / oxen DNA. The term is also used for rogue Guardians and Riders huum or near-huum who have gone off on their own for hire.  

Beqqua -- a Sogomsh word for "pure strain" humans. Same as "huum" in the bar languages.

Rompers -- a generally pejorative term for illegal gangs, some small and fly-by-night, others highly organized, who specialize in robbery, assassination, espionage, spying and other kinds of black ops. Some are mercenaries- or assassins-for-hire. Others are more political, the armed wing of various militant grouplets, while others are tied to tribal affiliations as protection units, enforcers of local law, tradition, honor.  In a few cases, they have a religious-spiritual character and act on an ideology aimed at suppressing vice, heresy or wrong-doing. In some cases, it is simply a relatively small tribal militia. Pretty much any armed force not associated with one of the major players (Borded, Beshquohuk, Byenung, the Empafarasi) are considered romperi. See notes below regarding problematic use of the term "romper / romperi". 

"basiji" is a reference to a Persian/Farsi word that was used, and still is, to refer to either the revolutionary guard or the morality police under the Islamic Republic theocratic dictatorship. See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romper  It is the volunteer militia of the revolutionary guard.  This is a distasteful reference, though perhaps not an entirely inappropriate one. The word itself has a patriotic/volunteer meaning in the modern Persian/Iranian context. 

In this world, it refers, mostly, to what in D&amp;D we'd call an "assassins guild", whereas "bitamin" refers to a loose analog of "thieves guild" or "pirate association". I like the sound i" makes, and there is perhaps something to be said for an oblique reference to the hashishim. Although the Iranian romperi have a bad reputation and have killed many innocents, they are not "hired assassins", so in that sense the word does not really fit. Conversely, the romper in my world are neither patriotic, nor volunteers, by and large. So again, not a great fit. And finally, I have no wish to promote any positive notions, even if it is in the sense of "bad assess", of the real life religious thugs.

If I wanted to use this word in a more appropriate context, it would refer to the Fatunik Volunteers.

For the assassins guilds, maybe try playing on the word "bravo" (n.).  Manslayer as a name? Noisy Ones. Trouble Makers. Dinning. Dinners. Rackets. Murmurers. Rompers.  I like Rompers. Funny and evocative of Romper Room...as well as a reference to eRepublik that only cognoscenti would get.

-bek -- any entity with personhood. A generic term for any kind of sentient life. Often hyphenated to indicate their genetic mix, like huum-bek, gecko-bek, snek-bek and so on.  May be used  as a proper name indicating one's DNA mixture/sint tribe. For example, Petra Bearbek. Used to indicate familial relationships as in paterbek, materbek.

Bitami -- a generally pejorative term for illegal gangs, some small and fly-by-night, others highly organized, who specialize in black market trade. Often tied into schemes for thievery but seldom violent. Sometimes tied to larger networks, to political causes or groups, or to tribal affiliations.  Often associated with particular Inns or network of Inns. Some are practically indistinguishable from a secret society.

Byndir -- the traditional Fatunik view/ideology regarding gender. It promotes a non-gendered presentation for huum unless/until they achieve a certain status, at which point they are permitted and expected to present gender in a more obvious way. It is tied into the very hierarchical structure of Fatunik society, with its expectation that everyone should stick to their assigned role. It also reflects the Fatunik view on family and reproduction, which is that these are matters for the Authority to manage, and not up to individuals or small units to handle.

Fook, Fookin, Phark, Pharking, Tuking -- you know. Drop this stuff. It's weak. Find better, more interesting oaths.

Jax - the familiar name by which all Lookie's are addressed.

Jaxen - popularly refers collectively to all the Jaxes/Lookies. For those in the know (a small minority) it also refers to the machinic intelligence headquartered deep under the Krunkinotto Mountains who manufacture the Jax Lookies as well as other wholly machine-created intelligences. 

Huum - the huum genotype (in bar languages).  Also see beqqua.

Impuros - The relatively quantity of non-huum DNA in a sint. The higher the level of impuros, the less likely the sint is to be huum-appearing.

Kahila - a broad tribal designation for huum and sints living in and originating from the Kahila Lands, two provinces that have long been actively at odds with the Fatunika. Fiercely independent, the Kahila follow folk-ways distinct from but also in many cases syncretic with the other main cultural currents in the Saskan Lands. Considered a lawless community by many. Tied economically to many underground and black markets.

Lookie - a creation of the Jaxen, all named Jax. Lookies have a very huum-like appearance and limited cognitive ability as compared to a full-blown huum or sint. Lookies share an identical phenotype with many other lookies. There are only 4 known models. In our story, with help from Stanley, one such Jax Lookie takes a name (Remanj) and begins to develop a unique personality. More formally: Lookalikes. "Lookie" is a bit too cute of a take on Star Trek "wookie". Do better.

Outlander - huum and sints from the Outer Lands and surrounding provinces. These are all a part of Saskantinon. They are "outer" in the sense that they share a maritime geography, bordering on the Krbsh Sea, and a corresponding worldview that is distinct from Fatunik, Borded and Southern norms. It has a hint of being Kahila-influenced as well.

Machinic -- refers to animated, life-like creatures, sometimes with a semblance of sentience, which were entirely manufactured out of non-organic materials. What we would call robots.  Jaxen are machinic. Some widely-used riding and carrying beasts are known to be machinic.  There are many bugs spying on huum and sint society on behalf of the Jaxen which are generally not known to be machinic. The Central Intelligence of the Jaxen is, of course, machinic.  This term is awkward and not terribly poetic. Let's keep looking for a better one.

Puro -- Huum whose DNA has not been mixed with that of other species and who have no special/magical powers.  This term is OK. It should be used only by "huum supremacists" though, right?  By implication, others are impuro.

Seff -- An octopus-huum sint with a high degree of impuros.

Sint -- a sentient creature that is some mix of huum and non-huum DNA. May be either huum-appearing, only slightly different in appearance, or largely non-huum in appearance.

S'lah -- a refreshing nutritional beverage that typically has mildly alcoholic or psychotropic qualities.  Many varieties.  Lots of regional and micro-regional specialities. 

Yes-Good -- an approximation of a common phrase used in all the Saskan languages that is similar to our "OK".  A wide variety of nuances based on context. Would like to have one that is equivalent to an Indian (subcontinent) neutral head-wobble ("I hear you. I am neither agreeing nor disagreeing.")

Neologisms

Fun to introduce a few in a scifi/fantasy story, but don’t go too overboard without good reason

Words, phrases, modifiers used in the story may include...
-  "Bek" and "-bek" and "Trubek" to indicate a "fully huum" sentient. Why "tru"? How about "hummbek"? That is pretty funny for musicians (guitarists)! 

Try to keep a distinction between the “common language” — the one I am writing the story in — and the various languages and dialects referred to in the story.



"Bitami" is much more obscure. It has references in in chaldean and pythogorean numeralogy ('4' and '9' respectively), but that's it as far as I know. So let's play around with that. 49'ers, but means something entirely different here... 


Musical Words

Some musical terms I might like to play with in some fashion:

Beat - Beet
Cadence
Deceptive cadence
Candenza — an improvised cadence
Tessitura — range
Song cycles
Rubato — change in pace for dramatic, emotional effect
Obbligato — an extended solo song
Presto — go fast
