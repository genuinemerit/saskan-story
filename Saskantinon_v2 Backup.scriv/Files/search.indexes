Mac vs. Windows Scrivener
The Mac version is much nicer and gets alot more updates from the folks who make Scrivener. Their version numbering is a little confusing. The Mac and Win versions are not directly compatible, but if you EXPORT from the Mac version to “Scrivener 2 format” then you can open the project in the Win version.  To re-open it in the Mac version after editing in Win version, I think you have to import it, but might be able to open it directly. 

There is also a Linux version that is similar to the Win version. Same thing applies. Can open the (Mac) “Scrivener 2 format” projects. It uses qt4, so there is a little bit of config that can be done from qtconfig. (See: https://www.wayoflinux.com/blog/scrivener-returns)

Note to self:  I save my “Ball of Wax” manuscripts under..
~/dropbox/projects/BoW/bow-story  and occasionally do a git commit from there so they end up on GitHub (bow-story/master) too. Check Settings in Scrivener itself to see where Backups get saved… it defaults to a local directory.

About This Template
By default, when compiled (File &gt; Compile), this project will generate a document in the standard manuscript format for novels. Settings are also provided to make it easy to compile to a paperback-style PDF for self-publishing or an EPUB or Kindle ebook.

How To Use This Template
Inside the “Manuscript” folder, create a new folder for each part of your novel as direct subdocuments of the Manuscript folder. Two  folders have already been created at this level for you, with the placeholder title “Part”. You should rename these with the titles of the parts of your novel.
Note: The “Manuscript” folder is what we refer to in the documentation as the “Draft folder”. It’s just been renamed “Manuscript” in this template.
Create a new folder for each chapter inside the relevant “Part” folder and title each folder with the name of the chapter. If you don’t intend to use chapter names, just use something descriptive that tells you what the chapter is about. (You do not need to—and indeed shouldn’t—title the folders “Chapter One” and so on, because chapter numbering will be taken care of automatically during the Compile process.) The first chapter folder has been created for you with the placeholder title “Chapter”.
Create a new text document for each scene inside the chapter folders. (Upon export, scenes will be separated with the “#” character for standard manuscript format, or with a blank line for other formats.)
Information about characters can be placed in the “Characters” folder, and information about locations can be placed in the “Places” folder. (These are just regular folders that have had custom icons assigned to them using the Documents &gt; Change Icon feature.)
Character and setting sketch sheets have been provided which can be used for filling out information about the people and places in your novel. These are located in the “Template Sheets” folder.
You should not edit the documents in the “Template Sheets” folder directly unless you wish to change the templates (which you are free to do—you may wish to customise the sketch sheets or get rid of them entirely).
To create a new character sheet, click on the Characters folder (or wherever you want to create your new character sheet) and from the Project menu, select New From Template &gt; Character Sketch. This creates a new character sketch document for you to edit and fill in with your character details. You can create setting sketch sheets in the same way.
Alternatively, you can just click “Add”, or hit cmd-N, with the Characters or Places folders selected.
You can view character and setting sketches in the Inspector as follows:
Select the “Bookmarks” pane in the Inspector.
If necessary, click on “Document Bookmarks” at the top and switch to “Project Bookmarks”.
Click on the chevron next to the “Characters” or “Places” folders in the Bookmarks list and choose the sheet you wish to view. (Note that only folders with content show chevrons.)
A “Notes” folder has been provided for project-level notes. This has been set as the default Bookmarks folder in Project &gt; Project Settings, so that when you create a new document from the Bookmarks sidebar in a Quick Reference panel, the document will be added to this folder.

Compiling
Title pages and front matter are all provided in the “Front Matter” folder (between the “Places” and “Notes” folders). Different front matter is used for different formats.
Tip: You can open this document in a Quick Reference panel and have it open alongside the Compile panel if you need to refer to these instructions while compiling.

To compile to standard manuscript format:
Edit the “Title Page” document inside the Front Matter/Manuscript Format folder to ensure that it contains the correct information (by default it will use information from Contacts).
Go to File &gt; Compile…
Next to “Compile for”, select “Print”, “PDF” or one of the rich text file formats such as RTF, Word or OpenOffice.
Select either “Manuscript (Courier)” or “Manuscript (Times)” from the list of formats on the left (note that this list changes depending on the file format you chosen).
Ensure that the “Add front matter” button is ticked under the contents list on the right and that the “Manuscript Format” folder is selected in the pop-up button next to it. (This has already been set up for you.)
Click on “Compile”.

To compile to paperback PDF format:
Edit the front matter pages contained inside the Front Matter/Paperback folder.
Go to File &gt; Compile…
Next to “Compile for”, select “PDF”.
Select “Paperback (5.06” x 7.81”)” from the list of formats on the left.
Ensure that the “Add front matter” button is ticked under the contents list on the right and that the “Paperback” folder is selected in the pop-up button next to it if it. (This has already been set up for you.)
Click on “Compile”.

To compile to ebook format:
Edit or remove the dedication page contained inside the Front Matter/Ebook folder. Feel free to add any other front matter documents as required.
Import a cover image (preferably in JPG or PNG format).
You can store this anywhere, but it makes sense to place it in the “Ebook” front matter folder. A placeholder cover image is already provided—you will want to delete that once you have imported your own.
Be sure to check online for recommended image sizes, because the recommendations are constantly changing. The sample cover image provided is 2,500 x 1,563 pixels, based on Amazon’s recommended size and proportions for a Kindle cover at the time this template was created.
Go to File &gt; Compile…
From the “Compile for” menu, select one of the ebook formats.
To create an ePub file, choose the “ePub 3” format.
To create a Kindle file, choose the “Kindle KF8/Mobi” format.
“ePub 2” and “Kindle Mobi” are older versions of the formats. They are mainly provided for supporting projects created in older versions of Scrivener.
Select “Ebook” from the list of formats on the left.
If you have front matter documents other than the cover image, ensure that the “Add front matter” button is ticked under the contents list on the right and that the “Ebook” folder is selected in the pop-up button next to it. If you don’t have any front matter documents, you can un-tick “Add front matter”. (Un-ticking this does not affect the cover image.)
Above the contents list in the rightmost header bar are six buttons. Click on each of them in turn to go through the various available settings, changing what you need. In particular:
Fill in the metadata such as author name and book title.
Ensure your cover image is selected and shown.
Click on “Compile”.

Making Changes
There are various minor changes you can make to tweak this template so that it better suits your needs, as follows:
Project and author name: The default book title and author name used in headers and elsewhere can be edited in the metadata pane of Compile (click the tag icon in the rightmost header bar of the Compile panel).
Chapter subtitles: By default, Compile for this template is set up so that chapter numbers are added but not chapter titles. If you want to include the title of the chapter folder in Compile:
Click on “Assign Section Layouts” at the bottom of the Compile panel.
Select “Chapter Heading” in the list on the left.
Select a different layout on the right, such as “Chapter Title”. (These layouts determine how each part of your manuscript looks in the compiled text.)
Part titles: Likewise, by default part numbers are added but not their titles. To include the title of a part:
Click on “Assign Section Layouts” at the bottom of the Compile panel.
Select “Part Heading” in the list on the left.
Select a different layout on the right, such as “Part Title” or “Part Title Page”.
Font: You can override the font used throughout a compiled document:
At the top of the “Section Layouts” pane in the centre of the Compile panel, change the “Font” setting.
Note that fonts are not included in ebooks, however—e-readers choose their own fonts (and you would need to pay a hefty fee for a licence to embed a font in an ebook). The “Font” setting is therefore not available for ebook formats.
Page size: The “Paperback” format is set to create a PDF with a page size of 5.06” x 7.81”, which is one of the formats you can use with Amazon’s CreateSpace and is a popular size for trade paperbacks. You can create your own paperback format using a different page size as follows:
Ctrl-click on the “Paperback (5.06” x 7.81)” format in Compile’s “Formats” list.
Select “Duplicate &amp; Edit Format…”. The window will change size and content.
In the “Format Name” text field at the top, change the name to something meaningful (e.g. “Paperback (6” x 9”)”).
Select “Page Settings” in the sidebar.
Click on the “Page Setup…” button.
In the “Page Setup” panel that appears, select “Manage Custom Sizes…” from the “Paper Size” pop-up button.
Click the “+” button to add a new custom size and give it a name.
Enter the paper width and height. (Note this is Apple’s standard Page Setup panel, and the units it displays are determined in System Preferences under “Language &amp; Region” &gt; “Advanced…”.)
Click “OK” and then click “OK” again.
Click “Save” in the Compile panel. This will return you to the main Compile preview. You now have a variation of the paperback format using a different page size that you can use at any time with any project.
Making your own special folders: The “Characters” and “Places” folders are just regular folders that have been set up in a particular way; you can create other folders that work in a similar manner.
To create a folder with a custom icon, add a new folder, place it where you want it, ensure it is selected, and then go to Documents &gt; Change Icon to choose a different icon.
To create your own template sheets, create a new document inside the “Template Sheets” folder and set it up however you want (e.g. add text, change the title or icon, set default metadata and so on). Now this document will be available as the basis for creating new documents from the New From Template menu.
To make it so that adding a new document to the folder created in (1) always results in a document based on the template set up in (2), select the folder and go to Documents &gt; Default Template for Subdocuments, then choose the template document you created.
Working with chapters instead of scenes: By default, this project is set up so that you write each scene as a separate text document. If you don’t like to break things up quite that much and would prefer to write an entire chapter in each text document, make the following changes:
Rename the “Scene” documents to use your chapter titles and move them so that they are on the same level as the “Chapter” folder rather than being inside it.
Move the “Chapter” folders to the Trash. You should now just have a “Part” folder with your chapter text documents inside it.
Create a new text document for each chapter.
Go to Project &gt; Project Settings and select “Section Types”.
Select the “Default Types by Structure” tab.
Delete “Level 3 files and deeper”.
In the “Section Type” column, change the setting for “Level 2 files and deeper” to “Chapter”, then hit “OK”. This tells Scrivener that all your files contain chapter text, not scenes. Compile has already been set up to apply the right formatting to the section types defined here.
Using a custom table of contents in ebooks: When exporting to ebook format, Scrivener automatically generates a table of contents. If you would like to customise what appears in the contents, follow these instructions:
Create a document for your table of contents inside the Front Matter/Ebook folder.
Name the document “Contents”.
In the binder, select the documents you would like to appear in the table of contents (hold down Command to select more than one document).
For a simple flat list, hit Cmd-C or use Edit &gt; Copy. Alternatively, if you would like the table of contents indented to match the binder structure, go to Edit &gt; Copy Special &gt; Copy Documents as Structured Link List.
Click into the text of the “Contents” document and hit Cmd-V or use Edit &gt; Paste. The documents you wish to appear in the table of contents will now appear as a list of links.
If you intend to export to an older ebook format (ePub 2 or non-KF8 Mobi), select all of the text and change it to use a 12-point font.
If you wish to centre the table of contents, select the text and centre it.
In the Inspector, change the “Section Type” of the “Contents” document to “Table of Contents”. Now, when you Compile, your custom “Contents” document will be used instead of the automatically-generated one. The titles in the links of the “Contents” document will automatically be updated to match those of the final compiled ebook.

Sample Documents
The “Sample Output” folder inside the Research folder contains examples of documents that have been created by compiling from this template. “Standard Manuscript” shows the results when compiling to “Manuscript (Courier)”, and “Paperback Novel” shows the results when compiling to “Paperback (5.06” x 7.81”)” format.

Final Note
Scrivener project templates are flexible and are not intended to restrict you to a particular workflow. You can change, delete or move the files and folders contained in the template to suit how you work.

Like all templates in Scrivener, this project was originally created from the “Blank” template. We’ve simply added a few folders and set everything up in ways that should be useful to novel writers. Everything you can do with this project, you could equally do by creating a “Blank” project and setting it up yourself.

You can create your own templates by setting up a skeletal project with the files, folders and settings you would like to use for new projects and using File &gt; Save As Template.</Text>

            <Synopsis>Getting in the door</Synopsis>
            <Text>The old gray cur slipped quietly into the Two Moons, dropping a small handful of  tubits into the backhanded open palm of the off-duty basherbazooki watching the door. 
The basherbaz’ mumbled a greeting to the old bard: “Barqo. Been a while, dog. Where ya been to?”
“Grrrrr... Yer mother’s a bullock. Mind yer own business,” the dog-sint story teller replied in a barely audible growl. 
In reply the bouncer smirked and stomped a foot hard enough to give the old man a start.  With their sizable musculature, one might be forgiven for thinking that a basherbaz’s formidable leg-ends, shod in well-fortified Hadaki combat boots did indeed, as Barfalot had implied, end in hooves rather than the kind of feet  appropriate to a humo-sint.  Few folks in the Land Between Two Rivers speculate on such matters with such a person, much less joke about it to their face.
The old man sometimes called Sir Barfalot was well-known as a joker. 

An old dog can thrive in place like Rikila by knowing how to push things up to the limit of decency, or perhaps a tad bit more, but not any farther. Just enough to get a rise.  Maybe glean some info.  Not enough to get a stomping. 
Once inside the Two Moons, Barfalot found the Jax he was looking for.  Turning on his story-teller charm, he took a seat at a long table and shared a free wisdom lesson with the young Lookie.  
The Jax listened carefully, trying to make out words from Barfalot’s thick Growlish dialect:   “Listen, Jax, did you hear me teasing that basherbazooki at the door about his gigantic feet?  See ‘em?  Know why he keeps ‘em hidden in those boots?  Because a sint who appears to be fully human gets better grub and earns higher rank than one with an obvious mix of, say, humo and bos in their family tree. Know what I mean?  That’s why your basherbaz’   hides his hooves. See?  Get me?  Now listen. I let him know I know because that gives me some leverage. In case I need a friend. Y’see what I mean?  That’s how you earn leverage. That’s what I’m teaching you today.  For free.” 
Barfalot was aware that, despite their limited mental and verbal capacity, every free Jax wants to improve their understanding.  A Jax is forever trying to separate out in their little piece of the collective Jax mind. Teasing out bits real knowledge gleaned by lived experience from implanted memories acquired at the Farm can furrow the brow of a Jax in an aha way.  Barfalot knew that seeing that expression was one of the small pleasures that can make a difficult day more bearable. 
The Lookie wrinkled its forehead in concentration. 
A smile swept over the old man’s face as quickly as a biverfolk-crew shoots the rapids of the Bloo on their way back to Bivertoon.
They stared blankly into the old feller’s eyes with a look that said, “I understood about a tenth of that.”  What they actually said, entirely predictably, was, “Well met! Say, friend, my name’s Jax. Are you planning an adventure?  Do you need some assistance? I understand that you may need a friend, yes? Am I right?”
Barfalot’s countenance resumed its weary road-worn look.

In a mean space like the Bishopric of Saskantinon, in its cruel towns like Rikila, it’s not unusual for folks to take advantage of  Lookalikes.  Telling them lies in order to gain their confidence, to get them to do your bidding.  A typical scam was to take one on as an expendable crew member to do the dangerous work.
He tipped the clone an abeyt and instructed them to let the proprietor know he’d arrived. 

As he waited, Barfalot let his thoughts wander. He bore a name that’s just a joke to puros, as they liked to call themselves.  The so-called “pure” humos who dominated politics within the Ring.  It had been assigned to him by a none-too-kind puro who’d discovered his canine features and then enslaved him as an impuro, as a pet and an unpaid worker.  That was many, many moons ago.  Long before he’d become a song-catcher, and a bard and had - for better  or worse - gained the reputation of a mage.
He sometimes wondered if he’d had a name prior to that. He couldn’t remember. He suspected that the whole ‘naming’ thing was a humo habit anyway, and considered, as he studied the intricately-wrought beams of the bar-rooms ceiling, that when he visited the extensive warrens of the Alfer strongholds well to the south of the Ring, collecting the new songs made popular by their resistance movement, nearly every rabbit-sint he’d met introduced each other only as ‘my brother’, ‘the noble sister’, ‘our leading comrade’, ‘hero platoon leader’ and so on.
With his long experience of pain and suffering, Barfalot had a lot of pity to spare for all the “moon-spawned, star-born creatures of the night”, as the Heliop slander put it.  He didn’t believe a single one of the Sun worshipers’ ill-informed explanations for the many variations of life that had emerged since the Event.   
He knew enough about the Land Between Two Rivers, and many of the Lands Beyond, to have some pity for the puro-humos too, who, despite their illusions of superiority, also suffered in this life and, as far as Barfalot could make out, met their end as surely and often as swiftly as any other sints.  
Well. Except maybe those tied into the genetic line of terrapins and sea turtles. He suspected them of having inherited something like a gem of immortality from their sea-born ancestors.

It was time to have a bit of fun.
Barfalot threw back his head, cleared his throat, and recited, loudly, in the sing-song way of an experience bard, while tapping out a beat on the table, a bit of doggerel in oBark, the forbidden “language of the animals”, from the age-old Bard Songs of the Givakola, known and loved by all sints regardless of their station and community.
Practicing the kind of showmanship that earns a bard a pile of tubeyts now and again, he included in his recital some canine sounds that would be interpreted by most iBar-speakers as dog-sint, or possibly even the sounds of a natural non-sentient dog, expressing some level of disappointment:  that mournful country-yodel that only dogs can do with full justice to the form.  
It was the kind of performance that would get a sint reprimanded by the Day Watch, or hauled away by the Night Watch, in a Heliops-controlled town. It was the kind of performance that the patrons of the Two Moons reveled in and it earned him a loud round of cheers.
From the murky depths of the bar room came a chorus of especially growlish chuckles. Those denizens of the Two Moons who had a bit of oBark quickly picked up on his take on the old favorite, joining in on the well-known refrain with a harmony of various animal-toned inflections, “Oh if I had an abeyt / for every stupid thing a Jax said / I’d be richer than a Watcher / in the Fire Lands!”. 

The Jax had returned to his side during the recital. They told Barfalot, as the chorus wound down, that the proprietor would be with him shortly.
He reached into his small money-pouch, extending small retractable fingers from gloved hands to manipulate the coins once the paw-like protrusion of his palm was out of sight from prying eyes. To a casual observer watching across a smoky bar room, he was just an ordinary old fellow scratching his belly.
At 60-plus solar turns, ancient by typical measures. Barfalot’s secret to longevity included concealing his 20-some-percent canine mix not only from the Night Watch, but from anybody else who didn’t have a need to know the extent of his impuros.   
In perfectly fluent iBar with only a hint of an iBark accent, the multilingual and multi-talented bard said, “Jax, my friend.  I would very much like a bowl of s’lah while we wait for Master Kirill. Can you help me with that?  Here’s a kite for the barkipper and a kite for your troubles,” he said, deftly passing the small coins along to his front paw and handing them over.  

The Jax beamed with delight as they sauntered over to the bar, to all appearances pleased as punch to be helping with a mission, and returning in a jiffy to hand his new friend a bowl of the ubiquitous drink of the Saskan Lands.</Text>

            <Title>Scene 2</Title>
            <Synopsis>The Master of the Manifold Ways</Synopsis>
            <Text>“You scruffy old mage!”, said a very small voice in a syrupy iBerk. 

Bewitched from slurping the initial tipple of s’lah, Barfalot glanced up with a half-smile.  A delicious sip of the Two Moons’ famous spicy s’lah  has a fermented wallop that’s enough to sit an old dog down on his hindquarters.
The friendly Jax was gesturing in a confusing way. His mind adrift with  the initial wafts of a cinnamony s’lah buzz, Barfalot watched the gesticulations with  amusement before his attention focused the liquidy accent saying,  “Down here, old boy. I haven’t grown an inch since we met last.  And at my age, I’m not likely to have any growth spurts.”

His head clearing, Barfalot looked down.  The proprietor stood next to the Jax, the top of the ornament adorning his cavalier hat just barely reaching above the Jax’s knees. How a diminutive gecko-sint had come to manage the most notorious Inn in the most infamous part of the Rikila bazaar was an enduring mystery to many.  Not to Barfalot, who knew a great many things.  But to many other folks it was an enduring mystery. 
Still emerging from the initial s’lah-induced wave of nostalgic feelings, Barfalot considered that maybe he knew too many things for his own good.  Then he considered just the opposite. 
Neither thought helped to explain how he’d managed to forget the diminutive size of Master Kirill Geckster-of-the-Manifold Ways, proprietor of the Two Moons, prominent member of the Free Innkeepers community, and - some folks say - mover of recently acquired goods.  

Ever the coarsely-ground diplomat of song, Barfalot greeted his old pal with, “So. Still crawling through the cracks of the system, you fookin basimi scoundrel?  Or have you seen the light? Tell me brother-sister, that you’re ready to embrace the Sacred Fire and I will fetch the Night Watch. Let’s let them know you’re ready to submit. Yes-good?”

The proprietor’s human features were distinctly gecko-sint, particularly his head, which was considerably elongated.  It melded into the torso in a way that would be extremely unusual for a puros.  The skin had a distinctly greenish and slightly scaly quality as well.  
And of course he was very tiny.
Taking just the opposite approach to being impuros from Barfalot’s, the Master of the Two Moons chose to accentuate and celebrate his-her appearance with various fashion accessories:  along with the exotic hat, it featured a swashbuckler get-up featuring an over-sized and brightly-colored cape and boots, a bandalero tool-belt holding little knives and other contraptions.  To top it off Kirill carried a, relatively speaking, large stick whose knobby jeweled end emitted a slightly blue and shimmery aura. Whacking the Jax’s hip with his glow-stick, which clearly gave them a jolt, Kirill signaled the Lookie that the boss was to be raised up to the level of Barfalot’s nose. 

The free Jax squatted, then carefully lifted Kirill so that the Master of the Manifold Ways could stand on the clone’s thigh.
“Master Kirill, thank you for making time for me,”, Barfalot whispered, switching to an Iberk argot known only to animal-sint convicts who’ve spent a  number of turns in the Beet,  “I have serious tidings. Is there a place we can confer in private?”
“Let’s go,”  said Kirill and then yelled into the ear of Jax: “Take us to the garden!” and then gently whacked the clone on the head with that glowy little stick.</Text>

            <Title>Scene 3</Title>
            <Synopsis>Barkippers from Beyond the Edge</Synopsis>
            <Text>Master Kirill rode on the Jax’s shoulder while Barfalot slunk along behind.  As they passed the long bar on their way towards the back of the bar room, Barfalot cast a studious eye on the cetantionishy squad of barkippers.
Visitors expect to encounter the unexpected in the Land Between Two Rivers. It is a land of contrasts, a melting pot of cultures, languages and species and a relatively safe bulwark for enterprise, agriculture and trade. 
At the Inn of the Two Moons, deep within the Bazaar on the ‘starry’ side of the rebellious town of Rikila, one would expect to meet the unexpected. Nonetheless, few things are quite as striking as the first sight of the barkippers at the Two Moons. 
In a world where humo-sints have evolved from many special cross-pollinations, in a time when science and superstition merge and mix to such a degree that distinctions between the two are largely conceptual, it could still be startling to encounter, to put it poetically, if not quite correctly, a fish out of water.  

To be more precise, if less poetic:  an octopus-person out of water.  Much less six of them forming a kind of conga line rapidly serving drinks to a busy crowd of clientele. 
When a visitor orders a bowl of s’lah at the long bar of the Two Moons, it’s likely to be served by a team of multi-brained eight-tentacled denizens of the deep, creatures whose DNA is as much 40% from the order Octopada. Those patient enough to listen might even enjoy, along with their spicy intoxicating drink, a lugubrious story or two regarding the epic migration of the Tetricus family from their homeland, which they claim to be on the other ‘side’ of the world, that is, from beyond the Edge of It All. They’ll tell tall tales of having traveled through many “oceans” to arrive the Bay of Bar and up the River Bloo. Settling at last, of all of the s’lah joints in all the lands, at this particular curve of the Ring of Saskantinon.

A lot of sensible sints laugh at their stories.  Obviously, nothing can simply swim into the Mantemar from out there, from Beyond the Edge, Where Nothing Lives. Every educated sint knows that the navigable world-ocean ends where the Great Wall of Fire meets the Cataracts of Doom, right near the Edge.  

Barfalot allowed a brief smile as he pondered the common wisdom.  He recalled what he’d learned from his years sailing The Forg with a crew of practical, if somewhat piratical, Shanowan mariners, regarding the Familia Tetricus.  He’d learned for example, that not entirely unlike the most hard-core Heliops among the puros, who prefer to keep their sexes binary and separate, the male and female members of the Tetricus clan tended by and large to avoid each other, except when mating. 
Unlike the puros sun worshipers, though, who do so for religio-poltical as well as economic reasons, the story Barfalot’d learned was that the eight-leggers did so because the octo-lasses had the habit of occasionally dining on the octo-lads after engaging in the octo-sex act. 

As they made their way through the crowded room, he quietly shared some rare linguistic and sintological observation for the Lookie’s entertainment and education. The Jax nodded knowingly as Barfalot explained, 
“They have big eyes, short torsos, over-sized craniums, eight nearly sentient-in-themselves limbs each with a myter-long arm-span, not to mention a cozy habit of tightly co-inhabiting a space. Tetricusi octopods make for a formidable bar-keeping crew.  They exhibit humo characteristics like air-breathing gills in a more or less humo-like facial configuration.  Three legs are used to stand and perambulate. They have very basic vocal chords, and, at least in some cases, even some body hair.  They typically communicate in a squishy-sounding iBar, with the Growlish accents common to sea creatures in the region of the Krbshanana Delta. They tend to use a lot of gesticulations as well plus various colorations that only they seem to understand.”

The Jax waved his arms sympathetically, or jokingly, or in confusion, which made Master Kirill’s ride a bit bumpy. The proprietor reached out and bopped Barfalot on the head with his stick and bellowed, “Can it, canine.  Nobody likes a know-it-all. ”
Doing his best to approximate the octopodo-impuros accent as he passed right by the end of the bar, Barfalot murmured loud enough to be heard by the octo-fellow at that end, “Hey man, cool scars you got. How’s the wife?” 
This earned him a squishy chortling sound in reply, along with a gesture and a color display, which he thought probably meant either “Ha-ha” or “Jook off” or maybe both, followed by a spray of salty water, smelling of octo-breath, in his general direction.</Text>

First using a combination of small keys on a lock that was hard to see,  Kirill then tapped on a series of the decorative dentils, spoke a brief enchantment, something like “Vwah! La! Say! Saa!”, and they heard three large bolts unbolting.  The door slowly opened inwards.
Once they were beyond the door, Master Kirill motioned for the Lookie to get lost. He settled onto a small ornate chair and gestured for Barfalot to make himself comfortable on a pile of pillows and throw-rugs. After circling around a few times, to get a good look at the place and because that’s what always felt like the right thing to do before sitting down, Barfalot settled himself and directed one rather large and, if you looked carefully, somewhat pointy, ear cocked in Kirill’s direction, his eyes and especially his nose taking in what he soon grasped to be rather unusual surroundings.
Stepping through the door, they’d left behind a large, noisy, ill-lit, smoky room filled with an eclectic mix of sints touching every data point on the spectrum from puros to impuros. Sniffing around, Barfalot saw they had stepped into a quiet, tranquil space lit by an ambient greenish-blue hue.  He was entranced by the sound of quietly gurgling water.

Once his eyes adjusted to the light, he saw they were surrounded on three sides by a see-through enclosure, with walls of a solid but clearly transparent and largely scent-free substance.  Could it be ice? 
The transparent walls were neither freezing-cold nor melting. They were, however,  holding back a sizable body of water.  On the other side of the ice-but-not-really-ice walls were varieties of shell-like enclosures, and what Barfalot recognized from his journeys on the Krbshanana Sea as coral structures.  A light source emanated from within the watery realm.  
Kirill said nothing while Barfalot sussed out his surroundings.  As he surveyed the scene, the old song catcher searched his mind to recall a word he’d heard used for the first time during a retreat, many moon-turns back, with a small team of mostly puro adepts from the Society for the Reinvention of Aesthetics. They’d spent several days and nights, adorned only in simple purple cloaks, discussing and debating a proposed “revolutionary strategy for developing fully autonomous inter-sentient art forms as a means towards strengthening the post-structural transformation of private and inter-subjective spaces with an eye towards developing a popular communicative rationality that would, in time, lead to...”
Well, let’s just say, to good things for all the sints. At least that was the idea. 
Barfalot noticed something moving about in the water, half-hidden among the shells and coral.  It had tentacles.  Much like those of the octo-boys at the bar.  

“This is where the barkippers live when they’re not working,” Kirill squeaked. “As far as I can tell, only the males leave the water-garden. The females never do.  That’s their deal. I call it the water-garden because...”
“Ah! Yes. It’s an aquarium!”, Baraflot interrupted in standard iBark, remembering at last the ancient word he’d been searching for.  
“Ah. Kwaa. What?” 
“It’s a word from one of the Ancient Tongues,” Barfalot explained, “Aqua meant water and Rium meant, we believe, something like a watch-hold. So an ‘aqau-rium’ is where they imprisoned water-dwelling creatures, either for amusement or in preparation for slaughtering and eating them.”  
“Oh, sure, like a fish tank. We have one out back.  We keep the eatables from the Bloo in there until we’re ready to serve them to our flesh-eating customers. Mostly we buy from Bivertoon. Some from indie flesh-hunters.” Kirill matter-of-factly explained.
Barfalot, who, after a great deal of internal grappling with ethics, had abandoned flesh-eating many turns ago, looked down sadly for a few moments, but didn’t say anything. 
“Well, yes, but an aquarium was... well, evidently it had magical walls... like this material... a watery enclosure that you could see through. I had always thought that was just ancient myth.  But here it is.”  
Barfalot didn’t bother to share how one of the SRA adept had also posited that aquarium “was a potentially useful metaphor for developing an modified ontology that opens a space to create inter-subjective ironic distances for bridging communicative gaps regarding power and equality without over-disrupting deeply-programmed structural-identity concepts of terra/torial permanence”. 
“Yeah, dunno how they did that,” Kirill said. “Octopoo multi-brains, you know?  Whatever.  They did the set up.  Super-duper smarty pants of the sea and all that. Cost me a pretty bucket of kubytes, I’ll tell ya that. But worth it. Best barkippers in the business.  Keep to themselves too.  Not always up in your business like some busy-bodies.”
He stared rather dramatically at Barfalot at that point.
Choosing not to take the bait, Barfalot looked around some more and said, “So you call it a water-garden, eh? That makes sense. I suppose.  Hmmmmmm. Yes. Because it’s like being under the sea, isn’t it? In an octopus’s garden.” 
Barfalot stared at his host with an quizzical look on his face.

Kirill stood up and tapped his glowy stick on the floor boards as he spoke, betraying some impatience with Barfalot’s tendency toward analyzing everything to within an inch of its life, then making obscure jokes that nobody got.
“Anyway. You said you had something important to tell me?”
“First. Remind me. You are pledged to the sacred bonds of the Annaka Intimi, are you not, old friend?”, Barfalot asked.
Sitting back down but with is back held up very straight, in a commanding manner, Kirill said very quietly and entirely seriously, “You know very well that I am.” 
“And as the Master of the clan of the Manifold Ways, not to mention as proprietor of this renowned establishment, you have a large community to whom you are responsible as well.”
“Yes, that is also true. And I am dues-paying member of the Free Innkeepers Guild too. And if you must know, I supply the good s’lah to all the basherbazooki barracks on the sly as well.  And at a handy profit.  Any other nosy questions?”
“The Free Innkeepers Guild charges no dues payments that I am aware of,” Barfalot growled, a bit menacingly.
“Figure of speech. Figure of speech.  Moons and stars. Wanderers and bards.  You don’t have to be so freaking literal about everything. What is this, some Bivertonian inquisition into my business affairs? Damn Mages.”
“As I’m sure you are well aware,” Barfalot lied, ”there is no such things as a Mages Guild. And you know very well that I am a rationalist and that I make a perfectly honest living with the Bards.”
“As the ancients said, ‘Potayto. Potahto.’ All right then. Let’s not play word games.  To be precise, I am a senior consultant to the eastern free innkeepers bookkeepers fraction of the Free Hostelries Cooperative Council. So. As I am sure you know, that means I pretty much have to provide free goodies to whatever Riders show up at my door.  So.  Pretty much the same thing as paying dues, innit?  Wouldn’t you say?”
“Fair enough. I see what you mean,” the old philosopher concurred. “It is your role as an, err, umm, let’s say as an honest broker, and as head of an important sint-clan, that interests me more than your fealty to Borded.”
“Fealty? Fealty! Now, that’s a bit strong, Barfie. I know the old songs as well as you do. I have plenty of friends in Beaverton and even a few Alferine acquaintances too, as I am sure you are aware. But. Submitted.  Yes. Cross-born. True. As charged. I supposed I do prefer doing business with the Riders rather than moons-forsaken, sun-sucking Heliops whenever possible.  But ‘fealty’? Really, old friend? Really?...”

Barfalot trained his soulful brown eyes upon the diminutive Gekkota-sint’s big pupils, whose wide-awake nature was so characteristic of the Squamata order.  He pondered for a while life without eyelids, trying to have compassion for what it must be like to never close ones eyes.  
He blinked automatically himself when he saw Master Kirill, seemingly without thinking about it twice, lick his eyeballs clean.  
“Holy Jook”, Barfalot thought to himself, “this little guy could never pass for puros in a million moons.”
In a quiet voice, using the Beetish argot lest any of those octo-lasses had ways of listening in to their conversation through the bizarrely warm ice, Barfalot told Master Kirill what he’d learned about the so-called Royal Wind Riders.  
He confirmed that the longstanding rumors were, in fact, true. 
Or true-ish at any rate.
Or might have some inkling of truth about them.
More pertinent to a confidential chat with a fearsome leader of one of the larger basimi guilds, he described what he’d discovered in the ancient ruins far to the South, deep in the fabled Grumsh-speaking Lands of Groomsh: what appeared to be some sort of ancient apparatus for communicating remotely over long distances. 
As he’d hoped, the potential for profits to be acquired from the combination of these two tales quickly caught Master Kirill’s close attention. 

As they talked on into the night, their good s’lah being refreshed from time to time by the Jax, and just as Barfalot had hoped it would, the possibilities for serious political and cultural impacts resulting from these discoveries, if certain arrangements could be taken and various alliances forged, also began to take shape in the large and active mind of the diminutive Supreme Warden of the Annaka Intimi.</Text>

            <Title>Scene 1</Title>
            <Text>A cadre of Helioptic Specials wore disguises as buyers of raw materials for the Brothers of Pure Fear, a widely-known weapons manufacturing guild out of Rutonik.  
They strolled around Eelan Town trying to be nonchalant as they asked random townsfolk for directions to where the Dance would be held and inquired as to who might be performing this turn. Their disguises failed to fool the Eelani locals.  Quickly detected by numerous Eelani Sunspotters, both amateur and professional, who’d been doing business with folks from the central provinces for generations. They could spot a phony from a hundred leaps.  
Despite the good business brought by their Holistic neighbors, the Eelani were a reserved people holding deep historical grudges towards the Sun worshippers.  
Beyond a few friendly nods in the direction of the Path out of town towards the Weyrlands, and even more not-so-friendly nods in various random directions, no Eelan Town residents were forthcoming.

The counter-espionage Sunspotters Network of Eelan acted like a central nervous system for the eastern hill country.  Without any orders, acting on instincts as old as the hills themselves, Eelani freeriders were soon sharing far and wide, throughout the western hill country, bemused stories about the newly arrived Helioptic spies.
At mines, freeholds, farms and artisan manufactories throughout the region, the word spread like a spring breeze. 
Among those hearing the news were the comrades of the Old Mill Cooperative on the Upper Blue, upstream from Mabhkahol on the Eelan side of the river. The Mill had ceased operations for the season once preparations were completed for the annual Feast of the Full Moons.  
Folks meeting at the mill were a mixed group of Co-op members and others from the area who’d volunteered for provisioning a variety of vendors setting up during preparations for the dance, and for those handling the great feast that would follow.  Preparing for the Dance was a major entertainment for the hill folk. 
Among their number at the Mill was one who, unbeknownst to the rest, reported back to a Circle of Fives known as the Clockwise Sixth, code-named for obscure bio-musicological reasons as The Bees. 
Six other members of the Bee cohort rendezvoused further upstream. Making their way to Eelan Town along the path from the Upper Weyrlands, the Bees mixed in with growing crowds traveling to the festival from the hill towns and villages around New Weyr, sharing the buzz of excitement generated by the impending festivities.

Azron Gurdon traveled on the path from the Weyr Highlands too. Setting out once again on an obscure mission from the Agency, he liked to joke, quietly, and typically only to himself, that it was a  “Mission Inscrutable”.  
The old man joined a sizable group of festival-goers camped together for safety during the evening. They were still nearly a day’s walk to the site of the Dance.  Azron stifled a yawn while wandering from camp-fire to camp-fire, dutifully persisting in information-gathering efforts amongst groups of the tight-lipped hill people. They were seldom willing to share anything of interest. And were jolly good at not revealing not much at all about anything, Azron thought with an internal sigh. 
He wondered if he’d ever have an interesting conversation again, or if he was going to be stuck among these country rubes forever.  

The Eelani and Weyring hill people did take exceeding delight in teaching the old man with the odd accent about the sacred importance of the river-fish-on-a-stick. 
Once they deigned to speak, they never tired of babbling ad nauseam in their sing-songs accents about their favorite Holy Hills too.  Azron’d heard it all before, dozens of times, no, hundreds of times, over multiple generations. 
It was an old hill country prank. Having heard many of the same droll stories from the great-great-grands of these festival-goers, he was bored to the point of tears. Still. A job’s a job. The Agency would want to hear all the dull details. Again.
Pulling on something resembling a happy face, Azron greeted another group of campers with a hearty version of the standard local greeting:  “Hello fellows, well met! Do you have a song today?” 
Which in the local vernacular was understood to mean “Could you spare a splash of s’lah?”, of which there was plenty to go around and Azron was  satisfyingly soused soon enough. 

The Bees had been notified, through their liaison to another Clockwise Fifth cell referred to as the Sharpies that a person sent from the Agency would probably show up at some point en route.  
Azron’s description was known to them.  Once arriving at the camp-site they picked up on Azron in short order. 
Carefully, one by one, they casually made their way towards him, wandering about in a fashion mimicking his own.  As instructed, they greeted him with shy smiles and the odd remark, “Hey fellow! Have you heard a new song clearly today?”  
Azron knew something was up with these strangers.  But even Old Gurdon of the Lost Planet, as his boss had mockingly referred to him at the last staff meeting, couldn’t quite place it exactly.  
They seemed quite familiar with local customs, yet they carried themselves distinctly from regular hill people. And seemed to be doing so purposefully. Like they wanted to be noticed by anyone who was really looking for them.  
They moved too much like Weyrlings to be Heliopsic Specials. Were way too loose and easy in their manner to be Riders.  And didn’t act like southerners trying to “Be More Weyrie”, as southern kids liked to say, either.  And that odd remark they made in greeting, “have you heard a new song clearly”, not only was not a typical hill country phrase but seemed very much a wink-wink-nudge-nudge sort of acknowledgment regarding his former trade in his former… umm…lands.  
They seemed to be feeling him out in some subtle way, perhaps studying him for a response.

Intrigued and hoping buy a bit of time in order to study them in return, Azon tried a trick of the trade that sometimes helped to create a psycho-physical space in which he could observe folks more closely.  
The next time it happened, he heartily laughed at their odd remark, then asked his new acquaintances if they’d like to learn a game from his native region.  When they turned to his notice, he claimed to be from a remote fishing village just off the coast of the Isle of Wye.  The agent — or whatever it was — quickly agreed to the game.  The cohort gathered near him, along with others intrigued by his performance.

Azron announced, with a dramatically disdainful tone and loudly enough so that other folks near them in the camp could hear, that in his opinion his game was ten times more interesting than discussing the ridiculous mystical properties of a fish-on-a-stick.  And eight times more fruitful than a walk up any so-called holy hills.  
The local sing-song and hub-bub quieted down as a small crowd drew near.  The hill folk could see he knew their pranks.  They wandered closer to see if, as the saying went, perhaps the old man had “an auspicious ninth” — their colloquial way of saying “a clever retort”. 

If only they knew where my home village really was, the intergalactic traveler thought, as he  placed a drinking cup on a nearby stump and explained to the audience that the game was called “silently-stare-at-the-mug-until-you-blink”.  In a serious deadpan tone, Azron explained that this was a favorite pastime of the Wye fisherfolk and that doing it right brought interesting rewards.  
Dramatically pulling a pair of seeing-spectacles from his over-sized coat and placing them on his nose, Azron proceeded to stare intently at the drinking mug, the spectacles dramatically enlarging his eyeballs to the on-lookers.  Humming an old Wye ballad about the folly of falling in love with a lawyer from Biverton Town, and seeming to be looking for something in one of the large pockets of his oversized overcoat, Azron subtly adjusted their setting to scan the crowd for implants, machinic prosthetics, or other out-of-place weaponry.


The supposed business delegation from Rutonik took a room at the Inn of the Great Resistance near Eelan Town’s southern gate. They pretended to admire the ancient murals adorning the walls of the common room depicting the events of the First Great Terror.  They remembered to keep their opinions about The Great Wall of Fire to themselves, though one of them almost laughed out loud as a snarky remark occurred to him. 
The crafting of the murals was exquisite, the paintings kept fresh and adorned with emphatic embellishments done in the Eelan style, using shiny metals and stone-stuff to elaborate the motifs.  
Once gathered in their room, with the door carefully closed, the thoroughly disgusted lead Watcher spoke. As one who’d mastered Western styles and accents more thoroughly than the others, had plenty of experience with the Night Watch, and might even be able to pass for a Salofessian Loyalist who’d migrated to Qurol or Sungyte, he contested, with the firmness and determination of one aspiring to become an Elder of the Supreme Council of Besquohuk, as to the quality of their training and their lack of results so far in information-gathering.  
He berated them in the way that a “Father of the Real People” was expected to:  “You fools, idiots and weaklings!  Have you been staring at the stars?  For Sun’s sake, find your fire!  We know the Western Witch will be here. Be alert! Our job is to find it and subdue it and break up it’s network.  Do not fail in your duties to the Eternal Flame!”

The others bowed deeply in acknowledgment of the leader’s Authority, committing themselves to the stated Correction.  After completing ritual abasements, they made their way back to the Common Room for an evening meal and to mix with the locals.  None of them had ever tasted the western delicacy known as chillah, a stacked bunch of thin fried maize-cakes, layered between various types of local plant-food, dripping with the melted churned cheese of the Eelan mountain goat, and flavored with local chilis and herbs.  
They tried, somewhat ridiculously, to balance their new-found delight with the delicious Eelani cuisine and their desire to not appear as foreigners, with their desire to not appear like foolish gluttons under the watchful eyes of the Leader.  
A difficult balancing act. 
Later that night, the youngest of them, who was just fresh out of Guards Training and had been sent with the Watch due to exhibiting cleverness in languages, whispered appreciation to a bed-mate for the Eelani cuisine.  This earned a shushing, as well as a secreted hand grip of agreement.  They muffled their giggles, hid their smiles and continued to hold hands long after the Leader announced, “Quiet!” 

The Sun began to set. The Moons of Mantemar rose in their double-glory, almost at twin full.  Signaling the start of the festival days, early arrivals from the Lower Weyrlands and Western Barboskanti, dressed in colorful robes and capes and fanciful costumes, paraded onto the performance grounds.  
Southern dancers flowed to an area of trees forming the backdrop where the Great Dance would be held the next evening. They broke into a ritual of chanting and twirling  meant to bring happiness to the tree-spirits living there.  The dance and the chants thanked the tree-sints for allowing the multitudes who were about to descend for the use of this space. And they promised to take good care of the area. 
Eager scribes and bards. mostly from the southwestern lands, had also arrived. They were busy sketching depictions or developing new lyrics describing the details of this year’s festivities to bring back to their communities. 
A pack of translucent, nearly-invisible white wolves had traveled for many days down from the Krunkinotto in the hopes of disrupting this event with a gory feed. Hungry and ready for a good slaughter, they licked their chops anticipating the glory of taking trophies back to their masters.  
Lurking in the woods, they were suddenly spooked when the tree-spirits, awakened from their year-long hibernation by the revelers, detected the bad dogs. In their whispering windy way that no dog could ignore, they ordered the wolves, in no uncertain terms, to flee back to their masters if they didn’t want to suffer a barrage of broken limbs.

Jonn Jariqol was from a small village between Barbol and Terpinol, not too far from the Aran Sea.  Born with a bit of coyote and also trained, as  occultation teachers from the village liked to put it, in “detecting unsung notes”.   
Smiling as the wind whipped up Jonn noticed something of the unfolding drama between the tree-sints and the nether-wolves more clearly than most others did.  Whispering to a dance-mate as they twirled past on another, Jonn shared that “One day I’d like t’kill them wicked wolves once ‘n for-all.”

            <Title>Scene 2</Title>
            <Text>A group from the Devotees of the Purple Flower, an herbalist cult centered in villages not far from New Harvest, circulated among the others, celebrating the awakening of the tree-spirits and bartering their trademark purple clothing and accouterments in exchange for food, drink, tools, news and new songs or stories.  

The widely-respected Riverside Actors Guild of Barbol, working together with a small group of bug-crossed villagers from the hilly weyrlands to the east of New Harvest, assembled a 6-person team to drive a huge puppet depicting a mythical cricket-creature of a long-eared type. The long tawny pale green face of the hugely over-sized bug, with its remarkably piercing orange-yellow eyes and seemingly alert ear-tufts, gave a good impression of seeing-all and hearing-all while being utterly other-worldly.  
The great green cricket turned its gaze upon each of the dancers in turn as the puppet-team made it duck and weave and occasionally shake its herringboned patterned armor.  When it stopped moving, so did all the dancers.  They’d unfold its formidable wingspan while the revelers chanted all together, ever so quietly, and so powerful for that quietness, soft “chirp-chirp” calls, after which the wings would fold back in and the whirling dance resumed.
At the finish of the ritual of the blessing of the trees, the Cricket Dancers retreated to just inside the tree-line, where the giant facsimile stood perfectly still, almost hidden, throughout the rest of the festivities. 

Travelers from throughout the Weyrlands, Barboskanti, Eelan and Bordaloon began arriving at the fair-grounds south of Eelan Town that night. They continued to pour in all night and into the next day.  The air filled with rippling sounds of songs and conversations exchanged. The aroma of tasty morsels and hot spicy s’lah prepared on small cooking fires wafted all over the festival grounds.  

The Bees and the Sharpies arrived in their meandering way.  
The Helioptic Specials-in-disguise set up a booth purporting to sell faux-armor from Rutonik, to delight of a number of young ones in the gathering.  
The old man from the Agency and others on a variety of occulted missions, mingled throughout the crowds. 
Actors and bards always on the lookout for new materials. Plus a fair number of more serious scribes.  Many watched, listened, learned and in some cases recorded the goings-on.

Many of the arrivals were napping, having traveled a long distance and not wanting to sleep through the events of the night to come.
Azron Gurdon was too tall, too old, too well-equipped and too obviously, outlandishly from “far away” to simply melt into the crowd. The Bees continued to circulate around him in an individual fashion, still without openly revealing themselves.  He kept a keen eye on them in return. 
He also spotted several Jaxen working with Innkeepers and Brewers collectives who’d set up stalls to serve the festival-goers.  In itself, the appearance of a few clones working with their employers at such a gathering  was not the least bit out of the ordinary.  The fact that at least one of them appeared to be, according to his instrumentation, of a new model not previously entered into the Agency’s data base, however, merited extra attention and observation.
So far he’d not detected any other noteworthy enhanced mechinics or implants. Just the usual assortment of concealed weapons and light armor typical of travelers through the western lands.

As the gathering began to settle in, not too long before Full Moons Rise, troupes from hither and yon put on smaller performances prior to the main events.  After delivering several cart-loads of supplies to their customers, a group identifying itself as the “Festival-Going Comrades of the Old Mill Cooperative on the Upper Blue” unfurled a fancy bilingual banner. In elegant calligraphy it declared in both Eibar and Oober an upcoming show called, simply, “Dance School”.  
A cantor stood next to the banner, intoning the announcement in the two major languages of the Saskan Lands, and alternating those with the same announcement in a beautiful, lilting classical high-country Ahber.  This caught the attention of Azron Gurdon, who’d not heard the ancient forms of Ahber intonations in many years. Intrigued, he made his way towards the Old Mill banner.
The Bee who’d been embedded with the “comrades”, having spotted Azron coming their way, turned to one of the local kids milling around their fire, pressed a nibble in their hand and whispered, “Go tell the others to inform Our Mother that the Old Man is here.”   
Azron noticed the young one scurrying away but didn’t give it much account. At an event like this folks were constantly sending kids dashing around with messages, deliveries and invitations.  His attention focused when he saw the runner stop to whisper to one of the strange-acting hill people on whom he’d been keeping an electronic eye.  Tuning in to that conversation with a brief tap on his aural implants, he smiled and thought to himself, 
“So, maybe she’s here. This could get interesting.”

As the crowd coalesced around the small pavilion of the “Comrades of the Old Mill”, Azron easily picked out the spies from the Center. 
He gave a wee laugh, this time with a slight shake of the head. Bemused by their facile comprehension of Eelani capabilities, even after all that had passed between the Westerners, the Riders and the Heliops, he wondered how the Watchers managed to keep so many folks afraid of them.  
He pondered the means by which these great communities of humos, who’d lived so closely together for so long, and who’d faced so many trials and tribulations in common, after all this time, still understood so little about each other.  
He lost his reverie when the cantor switched first to Oubarq, and then, startlingly, to full-fledged Growlsh.  

The hard consonants of the far southern dialect, followed by the gnarling, rolling bellow of True Growlsh felt like a smack to the back of the head for many in the crowd, who laughed and roared their approval.  The Helioptic spies were visibly shaken. The use of Oubarq was highly suspicious in their home towns. Speaking Growlsh utterly forbidden.  At a stern glance from the Watch Leader, they quickly recovered their composure and attempted to fit in by offering a few mild hurrahs. 
Switching to a mildly-inflected Ourbar in the popular flowing, soothing rhyme-and-rhythm style of the “Sacred and Secular Songs of the Eastern Riverside Kahilabek”,  the cantor introduced the story of “Baleran and Rooma Go to Dance School”, a musical comedy wherein said young sints from a bucolic Herbalists’ village in the gentle southern weyrlands learn to stomp and snort like angry horses, among other poses.   
The performance unfolded with a great deal of falderal concerning herds of “wasted” antelopes involved in a complicated plot having to do with a bumper crop of canteloupe and cosmic retribution. Nearly every line in the songs dripped with double or triple entendres, many of them utterly ridiculous, a few bordering on the obscene, a few crossing that line, many a bit stupid, and even more of them very funny, especially if you’d had a cup or two of s’lah.  

One of the Clockwise Sixth made their way to Azron’s side during the performance. Azron smiled at their approach as he tapped out the rhythm of the drama’s final chorus on his knee, incidentally activating a recording device and sending a ping to the monitoring station to let them know his current location, to upload his previous recordings, and to clear his cache.  
After the applause and snaps and hand-waving and shouts of encouragement were done, he turned to the Bee and said in what he hoped was a friendly way, “Nice, eh? But I don’t really know what to say. So stupid. And yet so fun!”
The Bee was about to respond when a junior scribe, who’d evidently dipped well into an entire bucket of s’lah, tripped over a rock and stumbled between them. The young one apologized profusely babbling away in a learned Krbshside Eibar with the tell-tale school-boy inflections of a freshly-minted Terpinol Academy graduate.  
Said he’d been trying to make his way through the crowd to observe the “Dance School” up close, but unfortunately had had little sleep the night before, and possibly too much s’lah during the day, and so on and so forth, all in a much too forward way.  
Azron was not amused. Drunk young scribes were one of his pet peeves.  
And he certainly didn’t need anyone from the East Coast asking too many questions about his cover story.
Taking a deep breath, and recollecting his mission, he turned back to the Bee, rolled his eyes, and said, “You’d think the Masters of Terpinol would teach these little twerps some manners, eh?” 

The operative from the Circle of Fives stared at Azron, seemingly unamused.  Then leaned in very close and began to whisper rapidly and urgently in his ear.  Halfway through the earful, Gundron noticed the lack of a red dot in his eyepiece and realized that his recording device had been switched off after that young scribe had “accidentally” bumped into him. 
Annoyed and little bit nervous at not having detected someone who knew his gear that well, he glanced about trying to spot the young scribe. But they’d seemed to’ve melted away into the crowd.  Too late now, he thought, and re-focused on listening carefully to the odd message being muttered into his ear.
“A new one has been brought in as a member of the revolutionary community supporting the comrades of the Old Mill on the Upper Blue. Tell them. The new one is multiple. One is Two. Emerging from the Void, they will be the natural leader of the Workers Council of Greater Eelan.  The Materially Masterful Mother held a partnering ceremony, but the grooms did not appear since they were occupied with urgent affairs in Mabhakol.  Number One has smoked non-sint sea-catch with the Fisherfolk and she has drunk air-s’lah with the Royal Wind.  Everything is in place. The next offensive will be decisive.  The groom’s sisters stood in for them at the partnering feast. All is ready.”

As he began to figure out the import of this message, without turning his head, and trying very hard to not just let go with his dislike for the whole Saskantinonian tendency towards obfuscation and bizarre metaphors, Azron softly and simply asked if that was all.
“The comrades of the Old Mill are packing their bags now,” was the only reply.

Azron saw that the Comrades who’d put on the “Dance School” were indeed packing up their equipment. Evidently that last bit was just an observation, not part of a cryptic missive he’d need to decode.
Having caught at least some of the cryptic allusions, and trying to think of way to ask what they knew of his old friend Mikel Moballeq’s current whereabouts, or whether the infamous Monmar Massachawa would actually be making an appearance here at the Dance, he turned to look the Bee in the eye, ready to say, using appropriately cryptic analogies, “Say friend, where do the Fisherfolk smoke their catch now? And will Mother be joining the Dance?”

To his annoyance, the messenger had also vanished. 
“Dammit all to Betelgeuse”, he thought, both worried about what he’d learned, annoyed that this would probably mean an extension of his mission, and concerned that somebody might’ve heard what he said, Azron muttered, “Stick this damn sing-song serenade on a gravity shell.  Why can’t these Saskanese just speak plainly?”

            <Title>Scene 3</Title>
            <Text>As they packed up their things, the various comrades and hangers-on from the Old Mill discussed the highlights and low-lights of their performance. 
Consensus was that they needed to brush up on the canonical “fish-on-a-stick scene”, which hadn’t got as many laughs as they’d hoped it would.  There was also some goodhearted joking about the antelope/cantaloupe conundrum. 
Once they’d finished tidying up, and after checking with various customers to make sure everybody’d been supplied as expected, the crew settled in around their campfire for evening snacks — a version of the famous local chillah provided by the Inn of the Great Resistance in Eelan Town — and some freshly-brewed s’lah, using their own special blend of spices and herbs.
Azron who’d been wandering for a bit until he located their camp, asked if he could join them, offering to contribute some special spices to their pot o’ s’lah.  They cheerfully welcomed him.

A well-dressed scribe from Borded stopped by their fire too.  
Following a hearty “Well met!”, they handed their guest a full slurp-spoon.  The gang were enchanted to hear that the scene from “Dance School” concerning the river-baby who’d calmed the antelopes would be a key part of the Scribe’s review.  And it would be read out a few days hence at the Riders Retreat! The comrades tittered with pleasure. The Riders Retreat was a famous Inn in Qurol catering to Rider-folk from Bordaloon, Salofess and Mabalbesq as well as to more adventurous and less-quick-to-judge younger — and younger-in-spirit —  Heliopticons from the Inner Ring towns of the Borda Woods. To have their work reviewed there! It was quite an honor for mere hillfolk.

“Oh my stars! Do you think Birakay will be there?”, the delighted young comrade in charge of lighting for their production asked.  Everybody got excited at the thought that Birakay might hear about their “Dance School” number.  
Perhaps he’d make a new song about it!  
They would soon be sung throughout the Ringlands!  
The scribe demurred, not making any promises.

Upon urging from the weird old man with the oddball Wye accent, they agreed to a round of Azron’s game. They referred to him as “the old fisher from Wye” and to the Borded Scribe as “the fancy one”.  Setting a drinking-mug on the edge of campfire, they all stared at it intensely and asked the fancy guy to be the judge of who blinked first. 
This went on for some time. 

Shortly before Three Bells, having made some surreptitious repairs, and not too long before the Dance was to begin, Azron’s equipment notified him that the gang of Helioptic spies were edging closer and closer to the “Old Mill” contingent.  
But the surreptitious lurkers he assumed now to be agents of Monmar Massachawa were nowhere to be seen. If they were still at the gathering, they had cloaked themselves.  

The mill-comrade who’d played Rooma pointed at the one who’d played Baleran, laughing and shouting “You blinked! You blinked!”
“DRINK! DRINK! DRINK!” was the refrain as “Baleran” was handed a skin of Barbakal spirits and took a long draft of the potent liquor. 
Azron, who  had had his fair share of s’lah and had helpfully contributed a bit of his own potent special spice mix to the night’s brew, but was not as inebriated as he pretended to be when he stood up and urged the two stars of the Old Mill’s production to join him in his favorite Wye dance. 
“Come now, young ones! Let me show you the steps of the Isle of Wye Dance School! First we will flow… thus…  like one of the great creatures of the Deep!”

The one known a few generations back amongst certain singers of somewhat ill-repute as “the Comrade of the Light” pulled out his mirrors and reflected light from the campfire onto them. His hope was that this distraction would pull some eyes their way, and perhaps alert the Eelani rangers he knew must be watching the crowd, in case of shenanigans on the part of the Helioptic agents.
As they began to spin about, a drunken young scribe stumbled into their camp, nearly falling face-first into the fire. “Goopers!”, he explained, then belched. 
Azron recognized the interloper and was on his guard right away. Deftly dancing away from this “scribe” as he twirled about with the young folks, he considered sending off an urgent report to the boss about this one. 
He put it off as his attention seemed to be required for a developing situation at hand regarding the approach of the Helioptic watchers.
He then he also felt a slight twinge of, what, could it be… no… he thought, really?  It had been so many years since he’d felt that particular kind of longing for, well, for a boybek.  Especially for one who must certainly be centuries younger than he. 
Probably the s’lah talking, that’s all. 

The “trade delegation” from Rutonik had arrived at the Mill folks’ camp carrying serious looks on their faces. 
A bit in his cups, yes, but even more so trying and failing to dislodge a certain obsessive vision of the boybek’s cute bubble butt from his corrupt old mind, Azron found himself thinking, 
“These idiots look like that weirdly forlorn creature from my home world (so sad it is gone! Just gone! an entire civilization gone! Gone!!!… And here I am… alone… in this forsaken enclosure with these idiots who don’t even know they’re being experimented on…)  Oh, what was it called, so gloomy-looking (damn, I am losing my memory… I’m so old….), yeah, an  Unqnard, or Uggnorod, or something…”

Somebody was handing one of the Helioptic agents a slurp-spoon. 
Despite Azron’s best efforts so far to avoid him, the sloppy student scribe had made his way to Azron’s side, and was joining in their dance. 
The boy, who didn’t smell drunk at all, pressed up against Azron.
As they slowly whirled around in one another’s arms, the cute young thing pulled Azron to him tightly, and pressed up against him, whispered, distinctly, clearly, without the slightest hint of inebriation, into his ear,
 “I am the groom”. 

Then all hell broke loose — for an instant — as the Mill crew were rapidly rustled and hog-tied by the Helioptic interlopers. 
The undercover Watchers had positioned themselves such that when they took out their long knives and binding ropes, they made short order of immobilizing the Old Mill comrades, the scribe from Borded who’d promised to make them famous, as well as the “drunken scribe” and Azron.  
Seated behind the captured crew, the Leader of the Watch instructed his captives to keep their eyes on the fire and their voices quiet, lest they wanted a “correction”.  They all knew enough Helioptic gibberish to know this probably meant a quick knife in the back. 

Azron noticed that huge, thick red clouds were rolling in front of the two Full Moons.  He tried to discern an Agency ship hidden inside them, but it was futile. They’d never been spotted in a million years on hundreds of thousands of planets. Why should they be visible now?
Maybe I am drunk?, he thought. 
He was curious, though, when he noticed tendrils of the red clouds seemed to creep downward, downward, spiraling slowly towards them. 
The “drunken scribe” winked and smiled sweetly at Azron. 
Azron could see a boner pressing up in the boy’s pants.
“Holy crap,” he thought, “this can’t be real.”

He turned his head to watch as a tentacle of the red mist wafted around the ankle of one of the thugs from the central provinces.  
“We know you lot know where the Witch is. Tell us and you’ll be spared.  Lie to us and you will be repenting at the Festival of Reconciliation.”  
The Watch Leader was trying to impress his captives by using his “Father” voice.  They weren’t having it, most of them ignoring him, seemingly either not sure what was going on, thinking it was another game, or just not too concerned about it.
“Which witch is that?” one of the comrades asked, which caused a loud round of laughter.
The “drunken scribe” scootched closer to Azron, rubbing their thighs together and nuzzling his ear.
“Liar, liar, pants on fire.”, another said, giggling, 
“You know you’ll be in a Bivertoon docket getting out-argued before you get any of us to go to a fooking Burning in a fooking Heliop Town so fook you and your fooking band of ignorant, murderous wild-beasts….”

Azron interrupted the Mill-player’s drunken tirade.  
“Excuse me. What exactly do you intend to do?  Murder us all here in this enormous crowd of westerners, Riders and southerners? You know the Eelani Rangers already have you targeted in their sights, right? Rhere must be a dozen stone-throwers and cutters aimed at you right now. You know that, right? If any one of these sints is so much as injured, you’ll be hauled off behind a hill, never to be seen again, before this young one here — he nodded towards the “drunken scribe” at his side —- can say, ‘You are violating the Great Argument of Bivertoon’”.  
Having become adept at making his spine quite flexible, over the eons, Azron was able to turn his head almost 180 degrees to look directly at the Specials’ boss. He could see that at least a couple of the Helioptic agents were visibly getting nervous. At the same time, he was curious why they’d picked out the Old Mill Comrades to interrogate. His information-gathering instincts were on fire.  
He wondered if any of them knew that Monmar Massachawa was not “the Witch” whom they sought, as they put it, even if she probably was “the Mother”.

The Watcher spy who’s ankle had been wreathed by the red mist suddenly screamed in pain. “My leg! Oh Holy Fire! I am being consumed!” 
At this, the “drunken scribe” laughed, stood up and discarded his bonds like they were paper.  
An ethereal kind of cloak unfolded around him and lifted him up into the air, transforming his appearance along the way into a naked female form, which, to top it off, glowed in the darkness, and a mist rose around her as her cloak continued to undulate.
“Shit,” Azron mumbled to himself, “Jesse K. She’s been here the whole time. No wonder I was getting horny. That old witch. What a hot ticket.”

Producing a long thin saber from inside her billowing cloak, she freed the comrades and Azron and the Borded Scribe from their bonds with several quick cuts. Turning to the Watchers and shouting “I love the Dance!”, she twirled about, once, twice, and the third time left a spray of red where the boss watcher’s head had recently rested. 
Looking at each of the astonished Specials in turn she said, “Who wants to dance with me?”

They scattered in every direction, disappearing into the night.  Azron had little doubt they’d all be picked up Eelani irregulars before they could leave the fair grounds. He stared at the decapitated body of the Lead Watcher.  Its severed head was slowly rolling towards the camp fire.  
As Jesse K continued to twirl about, declaring “It’s the Dance! It’s the Dance of the Antelopes! Let’s dance!”, her cloak wound ever more tightly around her and the mist rose higher. 
When the mist had enveloped her entirely, she gave one last look at Azron, who reacted strongly to her direct gaze, and then she vanished.
Azron was glad it was dark. He didn’t think the discharge in his pants would’ve been visible anyway. But still. It was a little embarrassing.
“Damn,” he thought, pondering his  oddly erotic encounter with the famous Agency rebel, “No wonder the Agency is after her.”
Later he erased part of his materials and neglected to mention Jesse K’s appearance at all in his report, noting only that the comrades from the Mill had overcome and scattered their captors.
Later still, as he considered what had happened, he found that he couldn’t quite separate out in his mind the sight of the naked floating woman brandishing a sword from that of the young man pressed up against him. 
“Let it go, you old goat. It doesn’t really matter,” he concluded. “After all, they more or less only have two genders on this planet anyway.”

The comrade in charge of costumes gave a big sigh, and said,
 “What. A. Mess” 
A chest that had been neatly packed away was unpacked. They pulled out several blankets and cloaks, covering up the dead Heliop agent. The crew held a whispered conference about what to do, then quietly and neatly “re-packed” their things, leaving neither head nor headless body lying on the ground.

A series of fireworks shot up into the sky. 
Controlled bonfires were lit near the edge of the woods.  
The great cricket made a chorus of gentle chirps and responding “hoo-hoo’s” and “weep-weep’s” rippled throughout the throng.  
All eyes turned towards the stage for the Great Dance.  
Few took any notice of a small group of hill people taking their leave, carrying their things away in hill-country-style hand-carts. 

When a customer selling loaves of festival bread made from their flour hailed them, asked after their songs, and queried why they were leaving so early, the comrade who’d played “Baleran” said, 
“Turns out a baby is going to born at the Old Mill in three measure’s time, so we’re going to prepare the newsongs.”
“Let there be harmony in your brood!”, came the traditional blessing.
“And let there be songs to fill the air!”, they responded.  The troupe headed north, towards the River Blue, into the festive well-lit night. 

Watching from not too far away, enveloped in the dark, melting away into the crowd, the agents of the Clockwise Sixth, thinking always of the next victory on the next hill, dispatched runners in the twelve directions to share the news of the Encounter and to gather intelligence amongst all those Below who could be expected to have a voice in the upcoming Event.

            <Title>Waleran's Rest</Title>
            <Text>Waleran read Birakay’s message again. Then made a dozen copies for sending out with the next bunch of runners.  

Stay still and wait for them to return.  That’s what Lukando’d said to do. Just stay out of sight and wait for them.  

A close look showed rations left added up to two weeks worth of beast jerky and road gruel. Waleran’s tummy growled at the discovery.

Was Birakay’s message was true? Or a fantastic malark dreamed up before ascending, if that was to be believed. Waleran conjured up a phantasm of the image, doting especially on Birakay’s infectious grin as he faded away into the mists, carried off on the bridge of the Chrome Ark.

Yeah, fair play. Give the starman a full run, Waleran mused.

The light faded to dusk as he finished scribbling the last of the copies. Ehewing studiously on a bite of good Giváklan beast jerky, it was a small comfort to gaze at the fading phantasm. To recall that scene as night was falling, alone in a strange woods said to be full of dangering-folk, far from the warm homelands of far southern Uitbarbo.

Waleran’d hard tones playing from the hidden Kahila watchtowers of the Barbakal forest. It didn’t sound like Aranzen Doribah, the singing language Waleran knew well. And it sounded nothing like the garbled, growlish Oobarq drumming that the Alfer’s and other half-baked rebel groups liked either.  

There’d been snippets of song too, lilting sporadically through the distant woods.  Hard to make  out. Possibly a ritualistic Old Eeber that one can hear in the River Temple of Barbol during quadrennial liturgical celebrations of the Earth-Soul. Yet more distant than that. Resonant of optimism, but with a melancholic rather than triumphant uplift.

Waleran lit the tip of his brightwand and consulted the day’s star-telling charts.

This is ludicrous. He sniffed and snorted, trying to make light of the reading and of his sense that somebody out there in the dark might be watching him. 

I need to keep moving. Get through the Kahilabarbakal. Pass through the Juujal. Get into Róntana without getting snatched.  Deliver a copy of Birakay’s lyrics directly to the contact in Rútonik. Get across the river into Eeber. 

Righty-oh. Great waters, I wish Barqo was here with me.

Then what? Head on up into the battle zone north of Big Tree. Get past the Most Loyal Volunteers and their pharking mercenary thought-cops. Pharking Night Watch meat-eaters. Hook up with Mur’ray and the Big Tree Heliop Volunteers. 

Easy-peasy. Rolling on the Barbo. 

And if. When. No, if. No, if I should get snatched they’ll find Birakay’s little poem here is not exactly “brightly rendered sapient-realist literature”.  I’ll end up at the next Gleaming as the star attraction.

So. I can’t get caught. That’s all. Moons runes!  Wish I could’ve just handed this off to the Independent Scribes of Blue Bar.  Barqo said they’re the best in the business.  And he knows things.  

Could get it translated into Oober and Eeber and the ‘barqs. Baybe a few of the little ‘berks too. Then once the Bards start to spread it around… Who knows?   It’ll spread along the rivers, all around the Ring, maybe to other lands.  Perhaps it’ll mean something to somebody somewhere. Then. Stars ’n jars! Yeah! That’s the song.  

Hmmm… Maybe I could earn a few bits too. I’ve heard they pay well for good material in Blue Bar.  Argh.  Nah. Can it, you old dodger. Can’t waste time heading to the coast. Lukando’d turn a blue cow.  I’d never make it across into Blubaroon anyway. Damn Watcher’s mind-pharkers’d pick me off the moment I left the forest. 


Calm yerself, wizard. Plenty of wanderers and refugees and Fool-Knows-Who’s scurrying all around in these Barbakal woods.  Don’t worry.  No fear. Trust the Stars. Those message-runners will be back before too long. Good runners too. Freaky-deaky little rabbit-people.

Feeling the heft of its holster, Walleran’s next comforting thought concerned the two boxes of good metal Borded slings nestled at the bottom of his kit.  

My lucky night when I got a rapid peg-slinger from that Norgyte bang-runner at the Candlemakers Hall in Givákala.  Ha! What a character. What was the name? Shloe-Thirteen? Kept talking about the bear-riders he used to run with. Yikes. I’ll need it though. Probably.  Oh Jexa! Oh Mother of Mercy!  What am I saying?  I mean hopefully not, hopefully won’t need it. 

Probably will though… Shits on a sun dial. I should do some practice shooting.


Birakay’s new song spoke in the elliptical and poetic prose of well-crafted High Eeber, of the Riders and the Heliops, and of the Kahila, the Bivers and Mabals, of all the various Barbarosans, travellers and refugees putting aside their differences in order to turn back on a hideous onslaught of shadowy creatures.

As dark clouds roll in from the Lewshan mountains, lovers of knowledge from the ancient traditions meet to find common ground.  Waleran pondered the brutal conflicts he’d witnessed during his travels with Barqo.  Enough of a star-math to accurately predict when fine words might be the prelude to serious fireworks.


Despite singing fine songs, he muttered to himself, people can be real shits. The finest words can lead to the greatest betrayals. The ancient legends say that a raven-sint will befriend a wolf-sint just in order to tease it and steal its breakfast…  Out of old nervous habit, he looked around to see if anyone might’ve heard him mention the long-extinct flying species — something that can get a traveler in trouble in a Heliop town, and laughed-at in many others.


The Sun had fallen completely. Waleran peered through the leaves for a glimpse of the night sky, trying to read the position of the far wanderers.  A falling star on the eastern horizon caught the astrologer’s attention.  A quick calculation. A quietly-breathed chant to the Goddess of the Seventh Wanderer. A careful listen for its mental echo. He concluded that the Goddess was preparing a love potion for all the demented hucksters of the Saskan Lands. 

How had that verbose smarty-pants Engineer Quinn put it? “With their outmoded belief systems and lousy bio-programming, their disease has become malignant. Any healing potion might take a long while to effect a cure.” 

Waleran breathed a melancholy sigh. 

I guess that’s a kind of optimism, he thought, eyes fluttering to a close. 

Resting in the certainty that cool, defiant, courageous ones. Like oneself. Like Birakay and Lukando. Like Barqo. Like Phoenix Stanley Quinn and his friend, that argumenter from Biverton, Showan Biver-Wing. Like all the wise, brave, courageous, talented performers and players and teachers.  Soon we’ll be able to turn the present disorder into opportunity.  To make our way to safe harbors and good havens. We’ll enjoy one another’s company until the love-potion begins to work.  

Drifting off, Waleran imagined the watchtowers of all the great towns announcing a special song sung by the handsome talented Pilot of the Chrome Ark, Birakay of Qurol. Sung for all those carrying their hidden torch lights in the caves of resistance. A great Hum will arise across all the Lands of Saskantinon.

His thoughts picked up on his standard starry mantras as he drifted into sleep.

The true reading will be revealed.
All one has to do is be cool and courageous. 
A little patience goes a long way. 
Follow the purple light of the deep knowledge.  

Imagining all the bards around the Ring singing the new tune, as Waleran drifted off, the wafting of a distant song still playing in his head.


At a hidden turtle-sint campground two clicks to the northwest, the ancient Dance of the Declaration of the River’s Springs continued to unfold. A very, very slow-moving but deeply rhythmic Terrapin bop, it dancer-singers send out waves of gentle sonorous tones aimed at soothing the listener’s sorrows. Like a souvenir of happier times that settles the tremors of a troubled mind.

            <Text>Synopsis:

Having seen to the liberation of a cohort of Jaxen, and spent a good bit of time studying the Nature of Things with adepts of the Order of Monkery, PB next sought for a way to engage the southern herbalist communities in the great struggle against the monstrous invaders.

She travelled the southern lands for several weeks, stopping at every herbalist village to share her enthusiasm for wind-catching devices.  In more cases than not, her ideas were dismissed as &quot;unnatural&quot; but there were a few, both elders and younger ones, who understood the importance of developing more robust irrigation systems if appreciation for the herbalist way of life was to ever penetrate the thick skulls and stubborn attitudes of the northerners. 

Through these travels, PB developed a network of contacts amongst the herbalists and she began to have a deeper appreciation for the songs and legends about Morning Thunder.  During a trip into the southern reaches of the Weirlands, PB encountered for the first time the Terrapin Community centered in the ponds and creeks northwest of New Harvest.  After many slow and careful discussions, she began to understand that the fantastic rumors of a &quot;secret town&quot; were more than wild stories. 

She came to know of the existence of the Jexans, a warrior tribe of women, both bek and mixed, who tended to view all of the major forces-that-be in the Saskan Lands as various versions of the same patriarchal nonsense, when they rescued her from an assault by bandits.   PB saw in the Jexans the potential for reducing the Ascendancy of the Windlords, to check the power of the Riders, and to potentially deliver a significant blow against the Heliops, whom she had long detested. She was determined to recruit the Jexans not only to assist in defeating the Lewshan Menace, but to change the political landscape of the Saskan Lands by doing so.

The first part of her plan she spelled out in a message to her mentors in the Order of Monkery:  

&quot;Esteemed comrades, let us reach beyond the possible and blow our collective breaths on the embers of the impossible.  A concerted campaign of song, speech and occult messaging should be undertaken throughout the southland, especially to the west, where herbalists are most numerous, detailing in particular the mistreatment of the Feminine Principle -- and of feminine sints -- by the monstrous invaders from the Lewshan Hills.  We need only tell truthful tales about this Bad Treatment, drawing on facts gathered by our own Agents and by those in whom we trust, gleaned from the frontline fighters and from the refugees now fleeing the northeast by every means available.

&quot;Our campaign should commence at the earliest possible moment and take Priority amongst all of True Friends of the Monkery.  We should devise the campaign such that in no more than a Half-Turn of [Large Moon],  Her Majestic Healer and Warrior, the Jexan Mother might receive favorably the following private communication from me.  

I have passed into her area,  have some small influence with her tribe and expect she would be favorable to hearing a song sent by me.&quot;


Written in the florid elegant style of the region's songs, PB's missive to the Jexan Chief was passed along by members of the Balancing Bards of the Barbo, a traveling troupe whose shtick often involved appearing to float on water or air, balancing on beams, stones and other perches -- and sometimes being cleverly suspended by ropes -- while singing their verses.

A popular and well-connected group, their invitation to [the secret town]  was brought to them by a emissary of Zada, who explained that the great healer had set out on a journey to the northeast to bring comfort and solace to the refugees on the roads. 

In due course, a &quot;stage&quot; of logs and rocks and a couple of cleverly-concealed rope bridges was prepared near a scenic weir made of two huge stones and engineered in such a way, it was said by the locals, that its falling waters played a harmony suitable to accompany any truly fine song.  The Jexan Chief and her entourage emerged from the woods just as the company was tuning up.  She motioned for them to proceed using a gesture that could perhaps be described as a small dance in and of itself, her hands flowing in a rotation that culminated in a gesture of acceptance. 

They sang the words that PB had composed, using a localized version of an old Kahila tune made popular by Birakay at a scandalous performance in Qurol in which he had taken on a female presentation and sung a new song -- telling a love story between a northern boybek and mer-maid who lived in the Barbo.  If the Jexan leader was aware of the implications of using such a tune, made famous in such a way, she made no sign of it, maintaining a calm, cool composure while listening carefully to the brief presentation.

It went something like this:

&quot;Your most majestic Jexan Queen
 The Saskan Lands face foes unseen
The Forces of Women must be felt
When the Forces of Men are buckling
Confronting Evil that comes to slay
And seeks to see both bek and obek kneeling
Before the muck of its monstrous spray.

&quot;The voices of the free are harshly 
  Shut by foolish utterings partially
 Thought-out but brashly boasted by Men
 Who in the coming conflict will play
 The same old games of yesterday
 And omit to think that never again
 Could it be the Female Might which wins the day.

&quot;Lend your aid and wisdom now
  To let all the girlbeks know
  That victory over the Lewshanic foe
  By Heliopsic Force alone
  Means a prelude to a Southern War
  Means a song of Fire and Horror
  For Southern folk, for the Forests and the Weirs.

&quot;Oh Sister! Heed Mother Zada's call
 Cry the beloveds' downfall
 Cry the enslaved 
 Cry the abused
 Cry the dispossessed
 Cry the murdered
 Above all, her cry for justice.

&quot;Let the Women's Might be felt
 In this just and terrible fight
 And let not the huffing Riders' cries
 Nor the windy Westerners' claims
 Nor the vain Watchers' boasts
 Be the bardsongs sung  for the ages
 Without a woman's word to the Wise.

 &quot;I am a proud girlbek
  Whom your wanderers rescued
  In the wild woods of the weir lands
 When I was surrounded by ill-intentioned men.
 I pray on the day I can visit your woodland court
 To share the deepest joys of the True
 To celebrate the victory of the New.&quot;

When they were done, the Jexan Chief performed a kind of windmill-style hand-motion, flowing in several large circles as if gathering up energy from the waters and then letting it disperse around her, ending with her hands crossed over her breast, and then releasing towards the players a kind of fluttering wave as she and her entourage melted back into the woods.
 

 Six days after the presentation had been made, a lone Rider approached PB's camp in the Kahila Woods astride a fast beast.  The Rider slowed down and rode once around there camp, singing out several times, &quot;The secret song has been sung in Freedom.  The Original Ring will be restored.  There will be a Great Dance under the  Full Moons.  Let there be True Songs to fill the Air.&quot;

Panda took this as a good sign.  She told her companions that they'd be heading north at daybreak. And to prepare for hardships.

            <Text>Barfalot / Barqo
60+ • Always on the move

Role in Story
More or less a narrator, he is a bard, a story-teller and a song-collector by trade. Think in terms of Shakepearean narrator characters, but with more of a sidekick to him

The ironic part is that he’s not sidekick at all. He is in fact quite solitary — un-dog-like, more wolf-like I suppose.

He does travel easily through many different kinds of communities, makes friends easily. He knows more about the big picture than most characters.  His typical performances are more reminiscent of, say, Hank Williams or Jimmie Rodgers, than Bob Wills.  

Goes by various names, including Barqalot, Sir/Mister/Professor Berqelot, and so on. Got to get a fix on a better name.
Goal
By exploring his back-story, we learn about the geography, languages, communities, stories of the Lands.  By following his travels, we should eventually uncover the great secret of the Event.  He is something like the private investigator in a noir mystery.
Physical Description
20% canine, noticeable mainly in his hands, only slightly in his face. Hairy. Long but not floppy ears.  A slightly protruded mouth. Sharp teeth (canines). Acute sense of smell.  Dresses in an unassuming “country” style, mostly in black and grays.  
Personality
Avuncular without being obsequious. Thoughtful and philosophical. 
Occupation
Bard / Song-catcher. Also a member of various Mages guilds which he typically denies. 
Habits/Mannerisms
Likes to drink s’lah but not to excess. Will smoke a pipe if offered, but not habitually. Is a vegetarian for ethical reasons, though often has carnivorous instincts, which he must struggle with. 
Background
His parents were refugees from the Hot Delta. He had some siblings but doesn’t remember them well. They lived in the wild and on the fringes of villages. He learned to sing and to read at a young age, thanks to a some wandering bards. His father was killed by wild animals.  (He may have been selected for covert training by Agents.) Ran away many times. Often in trouble with the Watches as a youngster. Enslaved for a couple of years, then spent a couple of years at the Beet Farm, where he was often visited by his Mama, who encouraged him to become a Bard and not fall in with the basimi gangs. Upon his release, and after his mother passed away, he started wandering and gathering songs.  He spent several years with a ‘mages’ collective (again, possibly influenced by Agent) where he became aware of the true nature of the Event and the Enclosure, and studied philosophy in some depth. 
Internal Conflicts
Assimilation issues. Doesn’t wholly fit in with either puros or impuros communities. Has sympathy for both.
Philosophical issues. As someone who is aware of the nature of the Event and the Enclosure, he is often pondering contingency/necessity. How free can they be? What is the real nature of language? And so on.
Loneliness. Lack of / loss of family.  Often wonders if he could connect with his lost siblings.
Deep knowledge of speciation makes him a careful observer of puros/impuros psychology and behavior patterns.
Vegetarian with carnivorous instincts.
Is both nerdy and street smart.
External Conflicts
He is considered to be a potential criminal element by the Helioptic authorities, who keep an eye on him.
Animal separatists don’t trust his many connections with puros and Heliop communities.
His knowledge of actual astronomy puts him at odds with both Heliops and some of the more ‘woo’ star-gazer types.
His knowledge of ‘ancient secrets’ makes him both loved and feared by various cults.
His knowledge of the Enclosure makes him a person of interest among the Agents.

            <Text>Kahrn
Age • Barbol/Heliohlan

Role in Story
Rural Barbaros person caught up in the machinations of a Heliop town. We meet the mother/father when they come to visit the son/daughter who is being held in Heliohlan, as well as a variety of Bordawoods Helioptics.

Goal
Introduce the herbalists community. This will be a way to interweave love, knowledge of gardening into the story-telling.  Create a mirror that reflects the dire situation with hunger in the Lands, the critical importance of the Pollinators (who are called… something other than “Herbalists”…), the desperation that ensues from the hunger.

Think a little bit of Gretel from Hansel and Gretel. A rural “innocent” preyed up by both “bad” and “good” witches. 

Physical Description

Herbalists come in many sizes, shapes, forms.  Love of gardening, use of herbs for healing and so on is a practice that crosses over the religious/ideological/genetic divides. There are both Sun-worshipping and Moons-worshipping herbalists, and from other traditions too.  Generally speaking their knowledge and practices are similar — they can learn from each other and provide one of the bridges between communities.

Herbalism is especially strong south of the rivers, where it is practically the &quot;national&quot; religion, inter-twined with the Earth-Soul beliefs of many residents, tying together their understanding of the river, nature and so on. 
Personality
The herbalist family are from the Barboskanti countryside outside of Barbol, between the Ring and the River.  This is an Oober-speaking area where devotion to the Earth-Soul is very strong.  

Occupation
The offspring had gone across the river looking for [a special type of herb] thought to grow only in the Borda Woods, in order to treat an illness in the village back home. One thing led to another and it ended up being a trip all the way to Heliohlan — maybe at the invitation of some kind Helioptic herbalists? Maybe an opportunity to get a job with higher pay / greater prestige than could be obtained in short time going through the lengthy apprentice process back home. 

One there, things got a little dicey. 

Habits/Mannerisms


Background

Kahrn’s story intersects with Barfalot’s (and possibly others') travels to the west
Internal Conflicts
The son/daughter has knowledge of the location of some of the rare roots of Terpinol, a legendary “magical” root vegetable said to grant longevity.  This is not something to be shared with the shorter-lived Heliops, but s/he is tempted to do so.  May be a love interest, Romeo/Juliet situation. 

External Conflicts
Tried to leave town without permission in a strictly-controlled Helioptic town — Heliohan. Taken into custody. Had to pay a fine but didn’t have the bits. Released due to help from Helio-herbalists, but still forbidden to leave town.  Must report to the Day Watch every week, which includes indoctrination into Sun-worship.  Parents come to help him/her get home, are disappointed/afraid of the extend to which offspring has been both abused by and won over by the Heliops. 

Notes
Need to flesh out the family more, where they come from in the South, etc.

            <Title>Kam</Title>
            <Text>Kam
29 seasons • Givákala

Role in Story
A typical Helioptic believer and worker.

A worker who awakes to class consciousness, with humor.

Think wise fool. Think Charlie Chaplin.
Kam stumbles into most of the situations in which he gets involved, evaluating their meaning only later.

Goal
Help to depict part of the great network that constructs the flying machines.  Tell a story of both assimilation and emerging identity, as well as fear of being “outed”.  Keep it complex. Kam does not hate the Helioptic community. He loves it, even though he feels estranged from it. 

Use his story to describe the gender politics/gender expression of the Helioptic community.

Physical Description
Hefty, solid with especially muscular legs. Having passed the age of presentation, performed a ritual of exposure, and mated, he presents publicly as male without fear or shame. But expects use of male honorifics only with his work gang subordinates, since he is not in a position of leadership &amp; authority in any other context. 
Personality
Plodding but genuine and big-hearted

Occupation
Carpenter’s gang lead. 

Habits/Mannerisms


Background
Abandoned by his parents at a Helioptic brooder house near Khaliro as an infant, he was raised in the Helioptic tradition in a fairly fundamentalist way.  Although he seemed destined for the Guards due to his size and strength, a Traveling Sister of the Way of All Things convinced his brooders to direct him into the Carpenters Guild instead.  Once he finished his apprenticeship, the Guild sent him to Givákala where he works mainly constructing ready-made materials for Volunteer Camps. 

He is the parent of two broodlings resident in Givákala.

Internal Conflicts
He has some oxen DNA, which he has covered up his entire life. His feet are slightly cloven.  Conflicted about whether to reveal this to his offspring. Although he participates in Gleaming activities, it is with concern that some day he may be exposed as “star-crossed” himself.
External Conflicts
He has been visited twice by the Traveling Sisters since they directed him into the Carpenters as a youth. Both times he was given a mission to build a small but relatively complex piece of machinery for them in secret, which he did.  One of his mates has discovered this side work and the Watch is now keeping a careful eye on Kam.

Notes

Not sure about this name. Maybe too simple. “Kam” would be a nickname or common name. </Text>

            <Title>Iohane</Title>
            <Text>Iohane
27 • Borded

Role in Story
Provide a harmony tying together events around the Ring, insight into the life of a Ring Rider.
A knight. A warrior-princess. 

Maybe I should kill them (Iohane and Henqu) off in the Gleaming instead of rescuing them? 
Make them martyrs.
Tell their stories in retrospect.

Ooooo! I like that!
Don’t want to steal TOO much from “Game of Thrones”. But killing the King more or less during the Fade In certainly got the audience’s attention! And using a successful plot twist in a new way is Hollywood-standard.
In this case, maybe we set up the audience to think I and H are going to be our heros, kill them off, shocking everyone, and that helps to reveal that our real hero is PQ and his cohorts. 

I need to figure out how / where PQ is on trial, for what heresy. I think we’ll now have Showan and the Biverton community more generally working on his legal defence.

Perhaps he is on trial for condemning the killing of Iohane and Henqu?
 
Goal
To hear the silence of a falling star lighting up a purple sky. To show the way. To tie together the old traditions and the new path.
Physical Description
Lanky but physically strong. Female/hetero, un-partnered but likely in love with Henqu. Like all Ring Riders, outward appearance/presentation is gender neutral. Usually seen only well-armored and armed. 

Personality
Outspoken in a fairly likable way. Good at intervening in dicey situations before they get out of hand, using her words to calm down conflicts.  But strong as an ox and twice as deadly when needed.
Sometimes called a &quot;wind witch&quot; by certain Heliops due to her knowledge of the western lands, but she is not related to any weyrland-based tribes nor is she affiliated with the Royal Windriders.

Occupation
Ring Rider.

Habits/Mannerisms
Always correct, as befits a Ring Rider, but willing to crack a joke to ease tensions, or to make a slightly racy or caustic remark in order to get folks’ attention. 

Background
From a hardscrabble farming village in the Norgyte. Most of her clan are battle-hardened, having defended their farms many times from Entropic raiders coming down from the Wesshewen plains.  Recruited into the Day Watch in Mizry after serving a time with the Volunteers, Iohane chose to abandon the Heliop barracks, voluntarily went to Borded when she was 21 to offer her sword to the Riders Council.  This happened after a chance encounter with a Ring Rider named Henqu, who impressed her immensely, not least of all with his song.  

Internal Conflicts
Prone to seeing the best in all the traditions and over-looking the worst, Iohane is a natural advocate for unity between humans and non-humans, between Heliops, Kahila, Barbosal, Arnazen and so on. She has a vast vision of post-Catastrophical unity that even encompasses the Entropic tribes and the faraway lands of Shanowa and Ayshewen. The threats posed by the monsters of the Lewshan Mountains, the unknown mysteries of the Forg and the Komexenon, and the dire possibilities of Re-emergence posed by the Bugs, or whatever they are, in the Krunkinotto, give her pause. She worries that only an apocalyptic conflict with such forces can remove the threat they pose, but she believes there is a “higher power” that will come the aid of the sentients.

External Conflicts
All the usual problems of being a cop on the Ring, plus some continuing meanness and vulgarity from former comrades in Mizry and the surrounding parts of the Ring where efforts were made to tarnish her reputation after she joined the Riders.

            <Text>Henqu
26 • Borded

Role in Story
Provide a rhythm tying together events around the Ring, insight into the life of a Ring Rider.  Some humor. Sort of my &quot;singing cowboy&quot;.
Sheriff in a rough town.
Goal
To hear that lonesome whistle blow. To be persecuted for the sake of justice and redemption. To endure a passion and become a savior.

Physical Description
Lanky but physically strong. Male/hetero, un-partnered but likely in love with Iohane. Like all Ring Riders, outward appearance/presentation is gender neutral. Usually seen only well-armored and armed. 

Personality
Reserved most of the time, to the point where some folks think he may have a mystical “starry” side. Boss-sheriff when necessary. Tries to remain even-headed and even-handed. Feels that both Heliop fundamentalists and Alfie-type extremists are “messing things up for the rest of us”. Drinks too much but sings like an angel.

Occupation
Ring Rider.

Habits/Mannerisms
Correct, somewhat laid-back in a cowboy-detective sort of way.
A knight. A detective. A sheriff in a rough town in the wild west.

Background
From a poor herding family in the Bordaloon. Left home to reduce burden on the family and escape rural poverty. Easily recruited into the Riders since he already had skills in beast riding and fighting. 

Internal Conflicts
Henqu has become increasingly “errant” with respect to the Code of the Riders. He has come to understand that he has some mild powers.  Although not strictly forbidden by the Code, it is pretty heavily discouraged and not disclosing one’s “abnormalities” is a violation of the Oath of Openness.  He loves and admires the Riders Guild and everything that Borded stands for, is worried about his standing if he “comes clean”, concerned he will be relocated to the outer provinces or assigned a less-responsible task.  Ring Riders, in particular, are discouraged from partnering-up. His evolving relationship with Iohane presents another potential “errancy”.  As the great conflict erupts and the “defection” of the Eelan occurs, his loyalties are stretched to the breaking point.
 
External Conflicts
Henqu is effectively a cop and something of a detective, as well as a bit of a spy for the Hosteleries Cooperative and other Rider-affiliated guilds/businesses.  He has had multiple run-in’s with neer-do-well’s, bandits, corrupt officials, bullies, legalistic eager-beavers (sort of literally) who question Rider authority on “their” section of the Ring, psycopathic Helioptic fanatics, sociopathic Alfie extremists, traumatized refugees, and so on and so forth. When rebellion erupts in Rikila, he is torn between sympathy for the Kahila-folk and orders to maintain status quo w/respect to relations between Riders and the Heliocastronate.

Notes
Would be good to do some sketches (written) showing the kinds of things noted in &quot;External Conflicts&quot;.

            <Title>Waleran</Title>
            <Text>Waleran Turnkey Tanaraka 
32 seasons • from the Uitibarbo

Role in Story
A guide and story-teller. A cohort of Barfalot and other key players. Provides the perspective of a traditional Barbasol astrologer with deep knowledge of the southern traditions and languages.

Wondering if I should just ahead and merge the Barfalot and Waleran characters? Think about it. OR make them more of a pair. Rozencrantzwiz and Guildensterndog.

Wizard-ly..  Has a connection, even if he is unaware of it, to Them (the Agency).
Goal
Provide the Barbasol perspective and bring the traditionalist, non-Kahila southerners into the story.

Get a deeper dive into the musical/bard traditions of the lands.

Physical Description
Tall, angular.  Always seems to be reading something, consulting charts/manuals, etc. 
Personality
Verbose, a bit of a stereotype of an overly-educated fool. Has a very high opinion of self and like-minded or seemingly like-minded folk. Nevertheless, is entirely capable of helping in a fight, especially through the use of mildly-advanced technology and weapons. 
Occupation
Has elementary knowledge of astronomy and mathematics, but it is warped by his strong belief in astrology and a system of fortune-telling that combines astronomical observations with calculations and chanting/meditation. Well-known especially for facility in divining the meaning of “falling stars” and “fast wanderers”. (Which we will eventually find out are mostly spaceships and satellites moving around in the outer atmosphere.)

Habits/Mannerisms
Very fond of Terrapin culture. Vegetarian.  Intensely interested in written materials. An expert in the southern languages, including Doremah.  Very fond of music and song but not a very good singer or player; as a result is a strong sponsor/fan of those who are, c.f. Barakay and Luvcando.
Background
Originally from the “wild lands” of Uitibarbo, considers Terpinol home. Has been to the Land of the Komexenon at least once. Has sailed on the Aran Sea and visited Aranzen. Is well-travelled.  Devout member of a Barbasol Earth-Soul cult, but -- rather unusually -- is also a leading [Star-Gazer] theologian/analyst.  Is utterly clueless as to the true nature of the enclosure, but has a fascinating grasp of the metaphysics of it. 
Internal Conflicts
Deeply cynical despite a fairly up-beat personality. Does not trust/is not satisfied with any of the main or secondary ‘powers’, including the so-called Wind Lords, the Eelan, the octo-folk and so on.  Has a nagging feeling that nobody really knows what is really going on (and is right about this).   A bit of a pacifist at heart, Waleran is conflicted about having to support / work with militants like Mur’ray.
External Conflicts
One of the players being actively monitored by an Agent, Waleran will occasionally get an  “external assist” in a divination in order to achieve a desired outcome.  This can contradict establishing stargazing algorithms, which forces Waleran to start to develop a more scientific outlook — which is fundamentally at odds with both Barbasol and Star-Gazer theologies. 
As a well-known Stargazer, Waleran is pre-sanctioned by the Heliocastron and has to be careful when traveling in the inner Northern areas.

            <Title>Morning Thunder</Title>
            <Text>Morning Thunder
Uncertain • New Harvest/Freedom

Role in Story
Personification of the Earth-Soul of Barbasol tradition

Even though I used to love it, I am thinking that this is a terrible name. Among other things, it could have problems with trade marks. Change it.  I do like the idea of having some characters with expressive names, similar to how in some North American indigenous culture folks are given a name that reflects their character around time of adolescence. But come up with something unique, not the name of a Celestial Seasonings brand of tea…

A warrior-queen. A giant. A force of nature.

Goal
Bring a perspective on the role of women, girls, female gender in the Saskan Lands.
Strengthen and deepen the herbalist and Earth-Soul story lines, emphasizing the critical importance of ties to the land, the earth in order to prevent catastrophe.
Physical Description
Very tall, big, curvy. Expressly feminine appearance. Can be combative if necessary.
May have some raven or similar DNA.  Speaks all the languages of the region with great facility.
 
Personality
Somewhat Falstaffian. Fond of s’lah, of which she is a provider of a potent herbal blend. 
Has had multiple lovers and many children. Gets along fine with humans but is especially fond of mixed sents.

Occupation
One of the leading personalities of the New Harvest matriarchal society, Morning Thunder is an important political figure in the western lands and well-known throughout the southern lands as a coordinator of many free/independent (non-Helioptic) herbalist collectives. The free southern herbalists are not exactly a “guild”, more like a self-governing member organization a la the Mondragon model.

Habits/Mannerisms
Often busy handling a wide variety of concerns relating to her town, her large extended family, her friends and lovers, the broader political and military situations, and the business of the herbalists collectives.  Works hard, plays hard, travels a great deal and usually makes a big impression anywhere she goes. Not subtle. A strong but fair negotiator. Has numerous gifts of healing as part of her herbalist kit.

Background
Nobody really knows how old Morning Thunder is or how she came to be. Some regard her almost as a goddess. Legends, songs abound about her. Some folks are surprised when they meet her, having assumed the tales about her are fanciful. MT herself has little recollection of how she came to be. It is a dream-like memory of emerging/coalescing out of chaos and growing/evolving with a wide variety of human and animal influences. She is often drawn to the river and participates in some of the most popular/ancient Barbasol rituals. She ages very, very slowly but is not Terrapin. 

 She was created as part of multiple Agency interventions several centuries ago, but she doesn’t know this.

Internal Conflicts
Being so long-lived brings its own kind of suffering in that she has seen many of her acquaintances, friends, lovers and children pass away. She feels the pain behind the Catastrophe like a personal event, and though she disagrees with their cosmology, their politics, and their gender culture, she appreciates the concern that Heliops have about preventing its re-occurence. 

External Conflicts
Some factions within the Heliocastronic Center see her as a threat due to her enormous popularity amongst females in particular.  They spread counter-propaganda aimed at smearing her reputation. 

Notes
Could be interesting to have sort of &quot;flashbacks&quot; based on Morning Thunder's dreams and recollections.  Will probably change the name eventually.

            <Title>Birakay</Title>
            <Text>Birakay
21 seasons • Qurol

Role in Story
Entertainment. A bit of a court jester. An example of being pulled from the Sunny Side to the Dark Side.

The Fool. The Lover. The Wood-Nymph. Also something of the Succubus maybe. 
Ultimately, another narrator like Barfalot and Waleran. The Muses.

Goal
Bring deeper perspective and understanding into role of Bards and song/music generally into the story line.
Provide some lighter balance to many of the “heavy” themes in story. 

Physical Description
Fashionable, “hot”, with lots of sex appeal. Often seen with a broad grin or smile. Though maintaining Helioptic gender-neutral norms, since Birakay is neither partnered nor holder of any official position of authority, his appearance and presentation is more geared towards distinctly “bad boy” male, but usually not in an extremely macho fashion. Think something like River Phoenix or James Dean around age 20.  

Personality
The most popular Bard in the Saskan Lands, a “rock star” of sorts. Sings beautifully, knows all the songs and performs well in ensembles as well as solo.   

Occupation
Since the Bards Guild is officially sanctioned in the Heliop provinces, his membership in it is an open secret, publicly denied. His official job is with the River Watch at the docks of Qurol, though his responsibilities there are murky and seem to consist mainly of greeting visitors along the river and along the Ring. Qurol is far and away the most free-wheeling of the Helioptic towns and the only one where the [mayor] presents as female. Birakay’s most raucous performances are at the great brothel house of Qurol.  In other words, officially he is basically a model working for the tourist board of Qurol. 

Habits/Mannerisms
While his public persona is carefully crafted and he enjoys celebrity status, Birakay is a serious musician and a strong defender of and advocate for bards, players, actors and poets. He spends a good bit of time working on writing and composing fresh material - some of it purely for popular consumption, other works remain hidden or performed only outside of the Helioptic provinces. In public he is outgoing, a bit brash, and flirts with everyone.  In person he is kind and considerate, abhors violence and prejudice, is gay as Christmas, and believes that radical social changes are needed in the Saskan Lands. 

Background
Raised in a Qurol brooder house. The natural child of a local innkeeper and an itinerant Ring Rider. Birakay exhibited musical talent early in life. He was lucky enough to have been noticed at an early age by the “mage” Barfalot, who used his back-channel influences to see to it that the boy was trained by local bards who perform sub-rosa in the back streets of Qurol. He was drafted into the River Watch, as are many Qurol youths. Once stationed in the barracks of the River Guards, he soon began to express male gender and explore homosexuality in an open way. The latter is not considered “bad” or even unusual in the Saskan Lands — whereas the open expression of male gender at such a young age was definitely considered “rebellious”. This might have caused some trouble for him if he lived in a different town and hadn’t soon become a local celebrity due to his extraordinary musical performances, which was directed into his role as a kind of spokesperson/advertiser for Qurol businesses.

During a sub-rosa Bard’s tour of the Eastern Ring, ostensibly as part of a Qurolian trade mission, Birakay encountered Azron Gurdon, who “marked” him to make it easier for the Agency to track his movements and provide monitoring, and Bucky Rogers, who both scanned him and caught his eye. In a brief conversation, Bucky described an idea for projecting dreams of Birakay for folks to enjoy even when Birakay was not present in person.  It was so weird, Birakay just laughed, but now can’t get the idea out of his head and thinks of Bucky often.
   
Internal Conflicts
Has not overcome his Helioptic ideological training and thus worries that his male expression and his embrace of new songs will help contribute to the Re-emergence (of the Catastrophe).  Is drawn towards various “resistance” forces amongst the Barbosal and the Kahila, the star-gazers and so on, particularly when they offer alternative views on gender expression and new music. 

Saskan equivalent of a “jet-setting” “rock star”, Birakay faces many problem similar to those in our world in this line of work:  exhaustion; many temptations regarding intoxicating substances and sexual misconduct; stunted emotional growth due to narcissism and ego-sickness; a feeling of lack of authenticity.  On top of this, and unlike our world, Birakay is not particularly well-compensated for his work. And despite the admiration of many fans, he is also the target of frequent criticisms from the Helioptic Authority.

In this sense, his life parallels that of a popular Russian rock star during the late Soviet era, when rock music was officially disdained but tolerated.
External Conflicts
His ever-deepening involvements with the Bards and other “mooney” undertakings has drawn the attention of the Night Watch. He is warned by both friends and foes to watch his back.  An opportunity to take on the role of the mythical Irate Monarch and to become the “Pilot of the Chrome Ark” in an epic performance of “The Dance of the Antelopes” staged by the Bards Guild of Mabhakol forces him to finally choose sides.  (See the “Story of the Hill People’s Dance”).

He gets involved in the “Circle of Fives” founded by Monmar Massachawa (the infamous MMM) and ends up providing cover for a plot that involved the kidnapping of a member of the High Council of the Heliocastron, the impersonation of the same at the annual Burning Days in Beshquohuk, where a hilariously revolutionary speech is delivered, and the release of the official into the Rikila Bazaar. This plot was considered to part of what led up to the Event in Rikila. Although Birakay’s role in it was never made public, suspicions abounded and he has been assigned for Correction by the Night Watch and is being monitored by the Specials.  

Read the piece on “Death of the Hero” in Jung’s “Red Book”.  Let’s have Birakay (and let’s get a new name… sounds too much like “Baraq”) be our murdered hero/assassinated god.

This will happen at a turning point in the epic, when it is starting to become evident that the tide is turning against the Old Heliops. About half-way through Act 3, at the height of the “purge” of rebels.  We’ll have a Volunteer — Kam possibly — get recruited to do the deed. There will be a torrential downpour in the wake of the assassination — where there has been drought and threat of famine up to that point. 

The “new song” of Birakey will redouble its effect, bringing redemption in its wake. I don’t want him to be a christ-like figure — that, if anybody, is Phoenix Stanley. Birakey should be presented as the best, “most virile”, “most genuine”, “most traditional” representation of Helioptic culture. He is Siegfried — with several twists thrown in of course. 

Need to think about who will be his Brunhilde — the one who betrays him. Should it be, even if accidentally, PSQ, the “new god” (of science and rationality)? Is that too… queer?

            <Title>Mikel Moballeq</Title>
            <Text>Mikel Moballeq
70s or 80s • Location

Role in Story
Descendent of the original settlers of Mobalbesq, elder of the Mobal Beshqi. Provides a perspective on the Helioptic authority from an “indigenous” (mostly-)non-mixed human tribe.  Offers a path to a cosmopolitan world view within the mix of eastern Saskan thinking and tradition. 

The King. The Prince. A Wise Father.

BRW, need some equivalent characters for other key regions, etc.… 

Who is actually part of the Helioptic Center?
Who leads the Riders Council?
Who is the head of the Windriders/Windlords (which is it?) “Royal” Line? 
Who are the Elders of the Eelani?
Who are the heads of the Bitami and Basiji clans?
Who are the heads of the main Guilds?
…
Goal
Depict a kind of “Shi’a” take on the “Sunni” orthodoxy of the Helioptic Center, a Mahayana take riffing far afield from the core Theravada Helioptic old school, while still remaining true to the main themes. 

Physical Description
Wounded, troubled, but still standing. Mikel, like the Mobal clan in general, endures.

Personality
Loquaicious, well-versed in Helioptic theology and terminology, but with an ability and a willingness to be syncretic and to be open to cosmopolitan views that endears him to many southerners.  

Occupation
Effectively something like the Governor of the province of Mobalbesq.  Is the jefe of a large estate in the Mobalbesq, involved in numerous enterprises. Has close connections to the Helioptic authorities, but is also on good terms with Riders, various southern guilds and tribes, sea-borne connections of various types, Beaverton, and, via Rikila, certain Kahila tribes and organizations. The person you want to know if you want to get things done in the Mobalbesq.

Habits/Mannerisms
Pan-sexual. Vegetarian. Has had many partners and admirers. As a person high up in the hierarchy, is free by Helioptic norms to openly express a male gender, which he does, but in an over-bearing way only on rare occasions. 

Background
Many stories and songs about his origins.  Sometimes it is claimed that Mikel was born in Shanowa and came to the Saskan Lands as a teen-ager.  He refuses to discuss his early childhood. Others say he was captured and mistreated by Kahila rebels for being the heir-apparent in a strong Helioptic sympathizing Beshqi tribe.  

His family was instrumental in the development of the “Beshquan Turn” in Helioptic orthodoxy, which led to the declaration of the Bishopric centered in Besquohuk, even if their local version of Helioptic theology differs in significant ways even from the “reformed orthodoxy” of the modern Center. 

Internal Conflicts
His multiple love affairs and relationships make his personal life complicated.  Some of his great loves were tragic, losing partners to battles or disease.  In other cases, they were strange and hard to fathom — meaning his encounters with representatives from the Agency, who seemed to appear and disappear like the wind.  In still other cases, he was deeply attracted to other men who didn’t necessarily feel so strongly, suffering from unrequited love, or in some case they didn’t have a desire for a same-sex relationship at all. His multiple off-spring from multiple relationships put the lie to his avowed Heliopticism, as several of them exhibit obviously mixed-DNA phenotypes.   There is an expectation that his role as something like “Sheik” of all the Mobal would pass to one of his kids, albeit only via a fair selection process, but he is not so sure he wants to visit this heavy responsibility on his kin.

External Conflicts
Has some serious conflicts going on with less-savory batami/basimi groups centered in the Kahliabarbakal.  One of his offspring has been missing for some time. He suspects that Xavi has been abducted by the bandits, but isn’t sure. There are also “fundamentalist” forces developing in the central woods, around Stanbuk, who are preparing Arguments declaring that the Mobal form of Sun-worship is heretical. 

Notes
Although he is a wealthy and influential and respectable personage, Mikel was a member of revolutionary Beshqi sect as a youth — this is why he never talks about that period of his life — and still has fond feelings for alternative approaches to Tomorrow.

            <Text>Azron Gurdon
Indeterminate • Here and There, Hither and Yon

Role in Story

Deus-ex-machina, literally. 

A fallen god. A devil. An angel. 
Goal
To fix things that are getting wildly out of tune. A cosmic piano repair man.

Physical Description
Old man with wild hair. Dresses for the road because he is often traveling or going to obscure places. Carries a number of tools on his person, usually concealed under an overcoat. 

Personality
Diffident but funny. Aloof but compassionate. 

Occupation
Is a field operative for the Agency with responsibility for both information gathering and occasional interventions.

Habits/Mannerisms
Loves the Earthlings, but has been instructed not to get too close to them.  His life-span exceeds (most) of theirs by many generations, so best not to get too attached to any one in particular. Nevertheless, he often falls in love or develops strong feelings and has had multiple affairs over the years with both men and women of various mixes.  

Background
Was a robotics/implants repair man on his home planet (which had 18 genders) specializing in ocular and aural enhancing devices. Kind of a cosmic optometrist and hearing-aide specialist. Has a universal translator kind of device available.
Internal Conflicts
Sometimes misses his home planet, which was destroyed due to internal conflicts and pollution and was not Enclosed in time to save it. Often thinks he should have stayed with the survivors who had left for a nearby planet on a kind of high-tech life-boat, rather than accepting the offer of employment from the Agency. Appreciates the efforts of the Agency to direct the Earthlings in a more sustainable directions, but worries on philosophical/ethical grounds that they are interfering too much.

External Conflicts
Does not get along well with his boss, who is a bit of a middle-management dullard. Azron often gets criticized for his tendency to go “off script” when in the field.

            <Title>Stanley Phoenix Quinn</Title>
            <Text>Stanley Phoenix Quinn
16+ (or older… maybe early 20’s) • Mobalbesq

Role in Story
The main character. The hero. 
A nod to Kim Stanley Robinson. 
Maybe some of the personality of my previous “PQ” character(s). 
See log-line. A sexy but shy socialist scientist. 
Socialist, in this context, meaning a person raised in the free spirit of inquiry characteristic of the Mobalbesq (more so than Biverton). 

(For the Biverton connection, see Showan Biver-Wing.)

Provide insight into life in Mobalbesq, the role of Mobalbesq committees and whatnot in shaping the destiny of the Lands. 
Brings a technical angle into the plot lines regarding flight, in particular.
The redemptor. The new god. 

Perhaps we’ll refer to him as Stanley, or Stan. Maybe Phillip or Felipe instead of Phoenix? Kinda like Phoenix tho… rebirth… the flight angle. SPQ rather than PSQ? Kind cool, maybe evocative of a hint of future empire…  Stanley Phoenix Quinn, Regent …
Goal
- Pose the main problems in the story…
   - So what is the REAL existential threat to the Lands?
   - What REALLY needs to be done to save lives, reduce suffering?
   - How is nationalist/fear-based ideology really combatted?
   - How to save the lands from famine and starvation?
- Connect Jaxen/Created to the main storylines, other than as an “evil other”.
   - Help to pose the problematic of advanced AI/ML.

Physical Description
Looks and acts a older than actual age.   
Has highly developed mental and empathic capacities, bordering on the telepathic which have allowed him to learn many things quickly at a young age.  
Has raven and bluejay DNA in his mix, giving him a strikingly beautiful look. And having avian DNA puts him in connection with “lost” (re-discovered in this story) strains of life. 
Shockingly black hair that is sleek but unruly.
Prefers to somewhat formal attire popular in the Mobalbesq — lots of black and blue, a few dramatic flourishes. Stuff that can withstand sudden storms. Lots of pockets for recording, inspecting, collecting.
Personality
A sharp, genius-level mind, and an inquisitive, playful nature that is intensely drawn to any phenomena not yet familiar.  
Something of the angsty teenage hero.
Something of the millenial slacker reluctant hero.
A punk rock sort of hero but with more of a new wave vibe.
A bit of James Stewart in “Mr. Smith”, etc.
A bit of Buckaroo Banzai.
A hero for ecologist youth.
A hero for people who really do want to save the lands.
Has “flaws” and “quirks” that get resolved in the course of the story:
- Socially awkward
- Intimidated by powerful ignoramuses
- Physically weak as compared to traditional “hero” types
- Confused, to some extent, about intimate relationships
- Pretty gay, is working thru that — but in a context where being gay is not considered weird, odd, other except in gender terms. Attraction to “male” gender expression is more of the struggle.
- Strong foster-family connections immunized him against groupthink early in life
- Private tutoring and innate intelligence makes him question orthodoxy
 
Occupation
Officially, an apprentice ‘maker’ in the ___ Guild of Mobalbesq (which has an appropriately verbose name), which does a lot of business in Biverune.  Has been recommended for consideration to graduate to master level, which is certainly deserved but requires a good bit of negotiation due to  young age and the need to navigate the carefully constructed Biverton bureaucracies and Mobalbesq politics.  

Skills far exceed normal expectations, with acquired knowledge in some forms of electronics and software that have brought him to the attention of various “dark forces”, as the Heliopses would say, including the Agency, the Jaxen, and various reform and revolution minded cults.

Habits/Mannerisms
Loves to express ideas loosely related to what we might think of as Buckminster-Fullerist “design science”… a bit of a Leonardo da Vinci. Far ahead of his peers in thinking about new ways of doing things.  Always thinking about how things really work. How to fix things. Both an engineer and a scientist.

Will play an important role in developing both the idea and some of the practical modes regarding flight.   A bit of Will from “Lost in Space” with respect to Bucky’s interest in the Jaxen.

Fascinated by botany, biology. Intrigued by evolutionary theory. Investigates the enormous amount of time, resources put into manual pollination. Develops the idea that pollination must have been done one time not only by random wind distribution and large animals, but by small animals, perhaps who could “ride the wind”.

Background
Bio-parents were from Beaveroon and Oobar but they lived in Mobalbesq, not too far from the coast, south of Selaron. They were lost at sea in a storm. Fostered by cousins of Mikel Moballeq.
Sent to the Academy in Terpinol as a youngster.
Assigned to the ___ Guild in recognition of extraordinary abilities in design.  
Has few “normal” friends.  
Has developed closer-than-normal relationships with several Jaxen, including bugs.
Is very sympathetic/empathic towards all types of animals and plants.
Likes boys. 

Internal Conflicts
An accidental psi-link with Azron Gurdon left Stan wondering if there isn’t more going on than meets the eye. Constantly searching for clues to uncover the true nature of things.  Has become somewhat aware of the Enclosure.  Is nervous, shy, reluctant about discussing any of this with others.   Beginning to realize that something, some one (the Agency) is monitoring him.

Attracted to Birakay, as many young people are. Gets a big boner when listening to Birakay songs being sung. Not sure what this means or what to do about it.
Often dreams (literally) about mechanisms for virtual dynamic visual presentation (i.e., film, animation, video, streaming, etc.) —  a type of technology that, like flight, is utterly unheard-of in the world of Mantemar.  This intersects with his obsession over Birakay, but also leads to problems in communicating with others, who tend to deride such ideas as foolishness or madness.

Is not pleased with Birakay’s close association with Helioptic thinking. 

Best friend and eventual lover becomes Showan Nye-Wing, a “prince” of Biverune. 

External Conflicts
The main storyline revolves around SPQ’s decision to bring his findings regarding pollination to the High Council (or whatever) in Beshquahoek. He is taken instead, by the Night Watch (but with a name that doesn’t directly evoke Game of Thrones.. LOL) to Juuj for judgment by Tonedo of Romperando.  He is threatened with extermination in the next Gleaming for heresy (shades of Galileo).

Showan alerts Barqo and others to this dilemma and helps to organize SPQ’s defense, which leads to social revolution — all in the context of famine, invasion and betrayal.

Funny/annoying struggles with Biverton Guild bureaucracy, maybe reminiscent a little bit of Kafka’s kind of deadpan humor. Get some running gags from that.

The Jaxen have instructions to terminate SPQ if knowledge of their collective plans gets too exposed. Meanwhile they cultivate him as a potential agent, sending operatives his way as honey pots of various kinds trying to understand what is known, how they might manipulate his knowledge to their advantage.

Theme
A variation on the Mobalbesquan theme, with heroic and hesitant elements. Something that can resolve beautifully. Perhaps sea-shanty-ish with a punk/new-wave sentiment, like that album that Sting did? Pirate punk, but more melodic than the Scurvy Dogs. More like The Dreadnoughts, The Pogues, Scurvy Bastards, Rum Rebellion, Brine &amp; Bastards, Mutiny.
A little bit of a polka-Roma vibe.
Notes

Use “Nye” (or similar) instead of “Wye”. Use the geography of Massachusetts and Rhode Island shore to flesh out some of the east coast. Blubar = Boston. Rikila = Brockton.  Selaron = Plymouth.  Morilly = Sandwich. Barqton = Providence.

32 • Somewhere in the High Weyrlands

Role in Story
Generally thought of as a bandit leader, which is not entirely untrue.  Provides insight into the culture of the High Weyrlands, a connection to story-lines involving New Weyr participation in the main story arcs.

A fallen angel. The dark force. The enigma. The anima?
Goal
Provide a strong female lead who is neither overly sexualized nor gender-neutralized.  Another connection to story-lines regarding flight.  

Physical Description
Tall, strong, lithe.  Has woodpecker DNA, which gives her something of a beautiful but very strong not-to-be-fucked-with “punk rock” look naturally. She is openly female but not femme. 

Personality
Commanding. Intelligent. Does not like to be trifled with. Does not suffer fools gladly. 

Occupation
Trained as an astro-pilot by the Agency, then returned to the Saskan Lands to assist in the development of the “wind lords” organization, mainly in order to counter the aggression of the Jaxen.  Ostensibly she leads a very clever bitami gang located in the mountains north of New Weyr called the “Circle of Fives”.  As the name indicates, these are interlocking cells of agents, each actually with 7 members, who communicate in a systematic way via the member of each cell designated as the “Dominant Fifth”.  In Saskan terms, this resonates as something of an argumentative take on  Scarcity and Plenty, with its philosophical emphasis on Sixes plus a Gap.
MMM or 3M, as she is often referred to, was instrumental in organizing a number of the actions that led up to the Event in Rikila and led to the astonishing “Arrival of the Winged Riders” that won the battle in the Town, sort of but not quite on behalf of the “Dark Side”. 
Habits/Mannerisms
A technical whiz, given her natural capacities and her Agency training. Has introduced numerous contraptions for use by the Circle, but is careful to hide the connection to the Agency, even from her colleagues in New Weyr.  
A consummate leader, she is always planning the next caper and thinking several moves ahead of her competitors and opponents. At the same time, abjures having a large public presence and is willing to take the same types of risks she expects from members of her network.

Background
Wanted by both Helioptic and Rider Authorities for numerous crimes, including piracy, grand larceny, kidnapping, terrorism, murder, espionage, “having incorrect and heretical thoughts”, “parasitism”,  and “the illegal propagation of subscribed song cycles”.
On her record at the Agency she is red-flagged for unlicensed operation of a deep space vehicle, attempted manipulation of the time line, and improper handling of wormhole gravitons.  She is also has commendations for expert piloting, expert marksmanship, and advanced understanding of inter-universal atonal vibrational dynamics at meta-quantum frequencies. 
She is very fond of many kinds of music and insists that members of the Circle learn multiple song cycles as well as some aspects of music theory.

Internal Conflicts
In her younger days, had an on-again, off-again affair with Mikel Moballeq. At one point it seemed that would develop into a long-term partnership, something that MMM was about to propose to MM, at which point Mikel and Azron Gurdon got involved in a long, complicated philosophical discussion that lasted for days. During this time, Jesse K contacted MMM and laid out the first set of proposed guidelines for the Circle of Fives.  This led to… well, a lot of work, and MMM never found the time to return to MM with her proposal.  She sometimes struggles with this decision, and occasional yearns not so much for a more peaceful life, as for one that she could share with a partner who is her equal and with whom she might be able to share her whole story.  She is kind of lonely. 

External Conflicts
Many. With the Jaxen, she is in constant combat. With the Heliops, she is a major threat to them.  With the Riders, she threatens their monopolies.  With the Herbalists of New Harvest and the Legalists of Beaveroon, she is too much of a trouble-maker, too radical.  With Kahila and other bitami and basimi outfits, she is competition. With the Agency, she is difficult if not impossible to control and often goes “off the radar” as well.  With the (so-called) “wind lords” of New Weyr, she must deal with a lot of stupidity and egoism from folks who are nowhere near her equal.

            <Text>NuWing Shown
26 • Beaverton

Role in Story
Foil to Stan and Birakay. Bring more depth of field to the Biveroon story.
An alternate hero. Kind of a stand-in for SPQ, especially in Act Two.
Organizes and promotes Stanley’s rescue and redemption. 
A bit of John the Baptist and St. Paul.
His love for SPQ leads him to reveal information about Birakey that leads to B’s assassination by Watchers send by Tonedo, so maybe a little bit of Judas too, but in this case, killing the old god.  So I guess that is more Brunhilde than Judas. Yeah. Cool. So… he is B’s lover first, then is attracted to SPQ.
In Act One, we’ll have Showan and Birakey be intimate in some way, or maybe indicate that they were at one time.  I’d kinda like the Showan/Stanely interaction to kick off right away, maybe in the Opening Image.
Act Two becomes, in some ways, their love story — but via separation, defense, rescue.. 

Nyuwing
Nyewing
Nuwing
Wingnight
Wingnigh

Another allusion to the flight theme.
Goal
Demonstrate some of the intricacies of the Biverune social hierarchies and relationships. Love triangle tension. Showan used to be attracted to Birakey, but falls in love with Stanley. Stanley admired Birakey, but was also very suspicious of him.  Birakey loves them both, but is kept from pursuing intimacy by his ties to Helioptic thinking. His relationship with them brings about new songs — and ultimately his own demise (dethroning). Stanley likes Showan but doesn’t realize how deeply Showan feels for him until he is rescued.  

Thruples are not a thing in either Helioptic, Biveroon or Mobalbesq culture, tho’ not unheard-of in Mobalbesq.  

Physical Description
Has the Biver DNA of the oldest families of the region.  Showan is part of the first families of Beaveroon. In this case, the “Wing” part of his name echoes some ancient Crow influences. Like Stanley, he is connected to flight genetically.

Considered exceedingly handsome by the Biveroon standards, and worthy of respect due to lineage.  If Biveroon had a monarchical tradition, which they don’t, Showan would be considered a Prince of the Realm.   

Personality
A bit over-bearing, maybe a little condescending but in a self-deprecating way.  Has a lot of sympathy for the struggles of others, even though Showan’s own circumstances are quite favorable.  

Occupation
At insistence of parents, who fear for any of their offspring being perceived as unproductive, was apprenticed to a Legal Scholars Cooperative (in Saskan terms, an Independent Beaveroonish Scribes Guild) in Beaverton upon return from Terpinol.

(He first encountered Stanley, who is several years younger than Showan, at Terpinol.)

Is presently involved in drafting some of the details for “The Argument of the Second Dam”, a radical proposal for damming the Blue south of Ingar, flooding much of the Barbakal Forest, and creating a waterway connecting the new “Great Kahila Lake” to Beaver Lake, thus connecting the two Rivers.
Habits/Mannerisms
Very inquisitive. A bit quick to jump to conclusions, but has good manners and is very adept at putting people at ease no matter what their tribe or station in life. 

Is exceedingly tidy. Not easily impressed by titles or claims to fame and a bit embarrassed about the standing of the NuWing family.  This is not unusual amongst Old Biveroons, who tend to avoid ostentatious displays, value “being useful” and have a near-religious enthusiasm for “re-use” and “avoiding waste”.   Unlike most Biveroons, Showan is not a strict vegetarian, eating fish and other sea-food as well as some types of reptiles and snakes.  

Basically an aristocrat, Showan is unconcerned about maintaining gender-neutrality given his high ranking in social hierarchies. This concern is considerably less observed in nominally-Helioptic Beaveroon circles anyway.  But when meeting with Helioptic officials or representatives, he is careful to behave in the accepted gender-neutral fashion favored by the Center for those not in Leadership roles.


Background
Highly-educated, well-read. Has studied in Terpinol, where Showan met and fell in (mostly unrequited) love with Stanley, and holds fairly cosmopolitan views.  

Since then, Showan has gone out of his way to check in with SPQ, show interest in his ideas and designs and has surreptitiously provided some influence and funding to support Stanley’s work. He has also talked up SPQ’s efforts as a potential contribution “The Argument for the Second Dam”, providing himself an “official” reason to see more of the young genius.  For his part, Stan acknowledges the friendship and likes Showan just fine, but tends to live in his own little world and doesn’t have any idea how much Showan desires him until we get into late Act Two and in Act Three they “live happily ever after”. 

On a trip to Qurol, when he was young, with a Beaveroon delegation, Showan meets Birakay, who was performing there. They struck up a friendship, Showan being his usual charming self and Birakay being flirty.  The famous singer was smitten, at least in part because he feels that Showan was one of the few people he’s met who saw him as a person and not just as an object of desire, etc.  Showan, like most young people, was happy to have met the singer and found him attractive, had an affair, which carried on for a while. 

Once Showan realizes that Stanley is nuts for Birakay, he uses his acquaintance with the singer to draw Stan and Bira, who is older than Showan (Shown), closer.
We’ll play this chord in all of its variations, throwing in a “Seventh” as well in the form of Bucky’s intimate relationships to various Jaxen.

Internal Conflicts
Often thinks about eating the meat of mammals and fowl, but feels guilty about it and has never done it (yet).
Pines a great deal for Stanley and is upset that his love is not (evidently) requited. Is ethical enough to realize he is “using” Birakay’s affections as well as the work on the Argument to entice SPQ, but the drive is stronger than the constraint.  He hopes (or we intimate) that their common avian ancestry will eventually out-weigh the attractions of the thoroughly-human “rock star”.  He has no idea of Stan’s ability to scan him and to empathically grasp his motivations.
External Conflicts
Much like Stan, but in a different sub-context, Showan struggles with the Biveroon bureacracies, with the added complexity of his own family’s conflicted connections to the local hierarchies. While this is partly internal, it expresses externally as we see Showan struggle to have his ideas and work accepted. 
Showan is one of the first to realize how deeply SPQ is involved with, and possibly being manipulated by, the Jaxen. 
Again, both an internal struggle — should he confront Stan about it / would that drive them apart? — and an external one: everybody knows that asking too many questions about where the Jaxens come from tends to lead to an untimely demise. 

Notes
Identify chapters, sketches or scenes derived from these character studies. 
For Biverfolk, let’s put family names first and make them fond of combined names using multiple capitals to indicate breaks, rather than hyphens or spaces. Thus “NuWing Shown”. Nu and Wing are his illustrious family names. Shown is his familiar name.

Theme
A variation on a Biverton theme, with aristo and romantic elements. If Kirill is “full pirate” and Stanley is “mildly piratical”, then Shown is “elegant river rat”. Let’s interpret that as like the Delta Blues and old-timey music with a steady rhythm and a jangly melodic line, with occasional flights of intricate picking and lofty refrains.

            <Text>PB, Peter Beckett, Panda Bearbek, etc.
18 • a wanderer and adventurer

Role in Story
A kind of foil to the Henqu/Iohane story-line. (?)

Someone who's native intelligence and curiosity reveals the doors into various secrets and occulted social settings, especially those underpinning the Herbalist eco-social milieu.

Similar to Kam, but on the Southern side. 
Think Borat’s accomplice. The Trickster.
Goal
Tell the story of a trans person in the Saskan context. Provide a strong, young female-gendered character lead who does not have to be a &quot;warrior princess&quot; type to be interesting, etc..

Physical Description
At age 12, PB's strength of mind was calibrated at 18 MMU's (very high) using the MHUP's eye stain test and intelligence rated at 20 using the RISC criteria.

At age 14, was physically transformed, at her own request, from a boybek to a girlbek, a transformation achieved by an &quot;illusionary&quot; of the White Hand (MTGAPU).

100% &quot;bek&quot; with genius-level intelligence.

About 4 feet tall with jet-black hair and deep-set blue eyes.  Usually carries several concealed daggers and is adept with a range of sling-shot style weapons.  
Personality
Has a great deal of natural charm.  

Occupation
Very adept at languages. Speaks, reads and writes nearly all of the Saskan languages. Has traveled extensively.  Sometimes works as a translator or scribes &quot;assistant&quot; (editor). 

Has helped various Beavertoon, ALF and Kahila rebel groups to produce propaganda and stays informed regarding official Helioptic, Mobali and Rider proclamations and arguments. 

An excellent mapmaker, researcher, designer and engineer; PB has worked with both weir builders and mining companies to improve their structures.  She likes to promote the Wind Rider innovation of &quot;wind-catchers&quot; (wind mills) in the lowlands as a way to improve/automate irrigation and grinding systems, but it is has not caught on very widely and has earned her a reputation as an Eelani sympathizer. 

Has been ordained as a professor of the highest unitary principles by the MHUP. 

All quite extraordinary for someone of PB's age and standing.
Habits/Mannerisms
Flirtatious, a bit of a &quot;Lolita&quot; character with something of a bad reputation on that score. 

Likes everything to do with bears.  Although not a vegetarian, very sympathetic to Fons and such, opposes cruel treatment of non-sints.

Background
Scanner Detecting Agency of Blubar has recorded information that she participated openly in the Uprising in Rikila, but was not effective as a street fighter and took refuge in New Weyr afterwards. 

Has spent some time sea-faring, where she learned a few words of languages used in the Aranzen and the Komexenon, and has an inkling that the world is actually much larger than is widely believed. 

Internal Conflicts
An orphan, sometimes wonders who her parents were. 

External Conflicts
Tends to question everything. Doesn't believe most of what passes for truth in the Saskan Lands. Driven to keep moving, wonders if she will ever be able to settle down / rest / be still.

Notes
Currently living in a camp in the Kahilabarbakal Forest.

            <Title>Kirill Geckter</Title>
            <Text>Kirill Geckter
32 • Master of the Manifold Ways

Role in Story
Something of a comical character due to his/her small size but large personality.  One of Barfalot’s connections to the underworld — especially the “thieves guilds” or “Annaka” in the local vernacular.  Kirill is one of the overtly “animal” characters, being 40% gekkota (gecko) and proud of it.  I am curious to see if I can play a “raven’s game” in the story-telling, in the sense that the sexual identity of characters becomes apparent (a) only once they reach a position of authority or leadership and (b) only once they choose to reveal it. This will be a pervasive characteristic of the fantasy world, but one that will hopefully come as something of a surprise to readers.  I see Kirill as a means to kind of introduce this concept. 
Goal
Kirill helps to reveal two important social organizations within the world: the Free Innkeepers/Hosteliers and their relationships to the Riders of Borded; and the varied world of the Annaki organizations, ranging from those basically supporting the resistance of oppressed species and poor classes, in some sense the representatives of the “rabble” in Saskantinon, to those merely obsessed with power, riches, lust and so on. 
Physical Description
40% gekko, with greenish skin, thick torso merging into the head with little neck. No eyelids, long tongue that is used to wet the eyeballs. Short by human standard, huge for a gecko; about 3 feet / 1 meter.  Dresses extravagantly with bandaleros and a cavalier hat. Something of a “Puss in Boots” stereotype — need to make sure there are enough distinctions, and that the character is sympathetic enough to not simply be a parody.  Short human-like limbs. No tail.
Personality
Commanding in a friendly way.  Always has an eye out for interesting acquisitions. 
Occupation
Owner/Proprietor of the Inn of the Two Moons in the rebellious town of Rikila. Leader of the Annaka Intimi (“Master of the Manifold Ways”), a thieves guild that is closely tied to various rebel factions.  Senior consultant to the eastern free innkeeper bookkeeper fraction of the Free Hosteleries Cooperative Council. 
Habits/Mannerisms
Kind of a squeaky/chirpy voice. Likes to talk, hum and sing.  Knows multiple languages. Prefers warm temperatures.  Needs warm clothing if temps drop below (70 F); can suffer serious harm in freezing temps; fear of winter.  Moves very quickly, including walking backwards. Adept at climbing.  Tends to be active at night and sees well in the dark. Fruit &amp; honey are preferred diet. For protein, prefers to eat insects.  From a parthenogenic line that makes no distinction between sexes. Prefers the gender-neutral pro-nouns ze, hir, dey, dem. (Note: maybe develop equivalents in vernacular and use those in the text?)
Background
Like all gecko-sints in Kirill’s line, ze was abandoned at birth. Emerged from the egg in an underground tunnel inhabited by rebel rabbits (vegetarians), who helped to raise hir.  The legendary ALF leader Mother Hare was one of hir mentors.  A quick wit, ability to move silently in many directions drew attention of some Annaki-affiliated hares, who recruited hir at a young age.  Ze eventually became appalled at their lack of devotion to the cause and disagreed with their intense hatred of all humans.  Some rough turns led to Kirill’s encounter with Barfalot at the Beet Farm, who later introduced hir to some Rider-Innkeeper elements in the eastern towns.  Kirill used a combination of skill and, umm, politics, to become the sole proprietor of the Two Moons.  Once established in a (semi-)legit business, ze founded the Annaka Intimi (roughly, “the band of siblings”) 
Internal Conflicts

Complicit in criminal affairs which leads to a never-ending soul-searching to find an ethical balance.
Highly intelligent and sympathetic to all, but often rejected by puros for being “too animal”

External Conflicts
Often in conflict with Helioptic authorities and compelled to call on influence with Riders for protection.
Also often in conflict with rival criminal gangs, and sometimes “on the hook” to do favors for those who aren’t criminals, but could expose hir. 
Legal work running the Inn is burdensome, some conflict with overwork vs. desire to live a more “natural” life in the countryside.

            <Title>Gallex</Title>
            <Text>Gallex
20 seasons • Isle of Wye

Role in Story

Represents a non-Kahila, non-Helioptic unshaped, unmodified human.   
Goal
Among other things, show the distinction between Stargazers and Astrologers.  

Physical Description
Part of the Stargazing [Pentrak] ‘Clan’, Gallex is lithe, quick, dark and strong.   Does not present a specific gender.

Personality


Occupation
Apprentice to a commander of the ‘Wyenaught’ militia, a mercenary group located in the interior of the Isle of Wye, driven ideologically by Stargazing, with ties to various militant and basimi circles in Beaverton, Wye, Morilly and Barqton.  Some naval knowledge, but mostly on the rivers not the sea. 

Trained in the use of knives and bows.  Is being groomed to help organize refugee defense units and possibly foment dissent within Helioptic Guard units. 

Habits/Mannerisms


Background
Parents were defectors from the Town of Stanbuk in the Tobaloon who’d rejected Helioptic social norms and started to live together as a heteronormative couple. They raised their first child themselves, in secret, but were found out when the mother was pregnant was the 2nd child — Gallex.  Although small families are not strictly contrary to law, they had also begun to secretly study Astrological materials.  When the eldest child was caught by the Day Watch singing a popular Kahila ditty having to do with the motion of the 3rd Wanderer, the entire family was sanctioned and scheduled. Fearing the worse at the next Gleaming, they escaped first to Brokilly then made their way down the Barbo to Beaverton.  There they were kidnapped and interrogated by the Pentrak Clan, who eventually took them away to the Isle of Wye.

The children quickly adapted and thrive in the free-flowing Pentrak lifestyle.  The parents work as field hands supporting the Pentraks.

Internal Conflicts
The Stargazer belief system is in sharp contradiction to Sun worship. It is effectively the mirror-opposite.  While the parents of Gallex had developed a kind of liberal opposition to the Sun-centered beliefs and traditions, the Stargazers have trained Gallex to distrust the parents, whom they still suspect as potential deep infiltrators or spies and keep fairly isolated from their offspring — just as the Heliops sought to do. 

External Conflicts
The family have been found “star-crossed in extremis” by the Night Watch, which is to say, more or less declared to be “witches”.   The fact that the kids are also now members of a Kahila-friendly armed group puts them near the top of the list of “enemies of the state” as far as Jook is concerned.

            <Title>Roís</Title>
            <Text>Roís [family TBD]
20 seasons • Traveler/Refugee

Role in Story
Communicate the depredations of the Cloned/Manufactured who control the Kronkinotto.  Provide a window into life in the western hills.

A side-kick to or part of the M3 network/Circle of Fifths, who gathers together travelers and refugees from the western lands.
Goal
Tell a story of refugees that brings sense of compassion and equanimity to the grander tale. With this character, I want to develop a sense of caring/kindness for someone who is not necessarily easy to get along with or to sympathize with. 

Physical Description
Lithe, hungry. 

Personality
Angry, despises the Cloned, of course. Not at all sympathetic to other technologically-enhanced beings and apparatuses.  Has never had much to do with modified or enhanced or mixed sentients.  Tends to view all non-humans as possible source of food.

Occupation
Hunting, trapping, fishing.

Habits/Mannerisms
Speaks only Eeber. Comrades in the Circles are teaching him some Eebarq words.

Background
Refugee from a well-to-do rural / peasant mountain village in the mountains of western Bordaloon province. Family and most of the village was wiped out in a raid. Roís is the only survivor.  

Internal Conflicts
Bitter, angry about the destruction of his family and home. Neither the Riders nor the Volunteers protected them. His prejudices against non-“pure”-humans are challenged via his friendship/alliance with the Fifths, who are open to all sents. His anger is due in part to the fact that Roís’s behavior back in the village was not exemplary and may have played a role in revealing the location of their village to the Cloned.

External Conflicts
May have a sibling living in Mabhakol.  May be secretly in love with a Jax agent.

            <Title>Mur'ray</Title>
            <Text>Mur’ray [family TBD]
18 • Refugee/Thief/Arsonist
Role in Story
Help to tell the story/background of the Lewshan Mountains.  Provide an inside view into one of the thieves/assassins guilds.
Goal
Use Mur’ray’s recollections to describe the Town of Ingar and the region around it.   Something of a villain, at least from a Helioptic perspective.  Another somewhat negative character, Mur’ray  needs both loving kindness and medical attention.
Physical Description
Tall, erect bearing. Striking, handsome/beautiful appearance. Very quick. Has a powerful emotional affect on certain people whom s/he stares at that causes something like a fever in them.  Has minor fire-starting capabilities using fingernails, which are flint-like.   
Personality
Cold, calculating, somewhat pathological. Afraid to develop close relationships.
Occupation
Thief, arsonist.  May have committed several murders. 
Habits/Mannerisms
Uses appearance, speed and emotional fugue to manipulate others.
Background
A refugee from the Lewshan Mountains, where her clan’s villages came under assault by (more) monstrous forces. Escaped down the [Bighotti] to Ingar. Recruited there by a militant Basimi faction from the Kahilabarbakal.  Has been deployed by them in attacks against Helioptic institutions in Ríkila and Rútonik. 
Internal Conflicts
Is literally burning up inside. Suffers a good bit of physical pain.  The fire mutation releases the pain.  Not using it increases internal pressure.  Probably needs medical attention or a more useful way to exercise special abilities, but doesn’t know where/how to get it.
The work with the [Basimi outfit] has not yet involved direct acts of assassination, but Mur’ray knows that this is coming and is not entirely down with that.  The “Big Tree” Helioptic Volunteers of Salotrize and Eeber are the main line of defense against the monstrous forces from the Lewshan Mountains who are coming closer and closer to the border every day.
External Conflicts
Is starting to feel used by the [Basimi]. This particular outfit has a cult of martyrdom playing out in their warfare with the Catastrophonics, but it seems to involve mainly the martyrdom of foreign recruits and young people.  The more events, as they call their raids, that are carried out, the more risk Mur’ray faces both in terms of being hurt or killed, and in terms of drawing the attention of the Watchers, the Special Division and so on.

            <Title>Luvcando</Title>
            <Text>Luvcando Randagan the Shanowan 
29 • New Weyr

Role in Story
Develop the story of the western lands as well as some hints into “foreign lands”, in this case Shanowa.

Goal
Provide a link to the Agency. Trigger some deeper philosophical inquiry.

Physical Description
Entirely human, but of an appearance not common in the Saskan Lands. Has a “foreign” accent, laughs more easily than most in this region, who tend to be a bit reserved/quiet. 

Personality
Inquisitive, opinionated, cynical. Has little patience with prejudices but is well aware of dangers and threats. 

Occupation
Ostensibly, a black marketeer of sorts, trading in custom-made cutlery and (small) weapons. 

Habits/Mannerisms
Enjoys banter with folks who can carry on an interesting discussion. 

Background

A spy from one of the Shanowan Lands, Luvca’s basic mission is just to gather info on the Saskan Lands. 
Luvca is also knowledgeable, to some degree, of the actual nature of the Enclosure and has been enticed with an offer of a trip to an Agency space station upon successful completion of mission to the Saskan Lands.
Internal Conflicts
Is not entirely sure if the info he has about the Agency is true/accurate. Was told to not reveal any aspect of it to folks in Saskan Lands but is finding it difficult to do so as trust is built up with the “Wind Lords” and honest, if misled, Stargazers and Mages.  
Also, has become fond of the Kahila culture, especially in Ríkila, and is becoming involved in intrigues relating to resistance against the Helioptic Watch there, despite instructions from home to stay neutral in any conflicts.  

External Conflicts
During travel from Shanowa to Saskantinon, Luvca became well-informed about the dire threats developing in the Lewshan Mountains. Understanding the need for relying on the Helioptic and Rider forces, for a broad united front, to counter the monsters creates conflict with contacts, friends, allies who in conflict with each other.

            <Title>Lohrn</Title>
            <Text>Lohrn the Carpenter
24 • Rikila

Role in Story
Give a perspective on the foreign lands to the west. Help depict internal workings of an important Guild organization.

Goal
Provide a “commoner’s” view of the events in Rikila. Someone who just wants to get thru the day without too much trouble, isn’t interested in joining any factions. 

Physical Description
Small, usually a bit messy due to constant hard working and tendency towards intoxicants. Has a “foreign” (western) accent. Does not have a partner and is not in a position of authority, so sexual/gender identity remains neutral/unclear in public settings.  

Personality
Smart. Observant. Quiet.  Tends to focus on practical matters, has an engineer’s eye for things.

Occupation
Is apprenticed to a member of the Carpenter’s Council (c.f. Otto Templaron Trucent).

Habits/Mannerisms
Quiet, somewhat fearful. Occasional bouts of drunkeness/intoxication. May be an addict. Has been traumatized and is reluctant to trust anyone. Years in care of Riders/Carpenters brought about better socialization, but has not addressed deeper scars.  

Background
An orphaned refugee from the far west, beyond the Krunkinotto. Home village was ravaged by Entropics (wild bands of marauders, common in Weshewen, but also seen further west), who enslaved Lohrn as a child. Escaped during a conflict with a Cloned outpost in the mountains, headed south eventually taking a raft downriver into Bordaloon. Learned to speak Eeber in Borded and was put into care of independent Brooders tied to the Carpenters Guild. After hearing the background story during a visit to the brood house, Trucent requested Lohrn as apprentice and then had hir relocated to Rikila.  

Internal Conflicts
Many psychological scars. Abuse by Entropics left alot of unresolved anger, which Lohrn keeps bottled up.

External Conflicts
Somewhat sympathetic towards the Cloned/Jaxens due to their role in freeing Lohrn from enslavement, an attitude that is typically very unpopular in the Saskan Lands and gets Lohrn into trouble from time to time. Deepening reliance on intoxicants is drawing Lohrn into unsavory (literally) underworld connections

            <Text>Otto Templaron Trucent
32 • Borded

Role in Story
A key link to the Agency and a “glue” that helps to tie together story lines for various characters. 

Goal
Introduce as a mystery and keep it that way, revealing bits and pieces about Otto as things unfold. 

Physical Description
Strongly male-identified, wears a uniform of sorts, maybe a cape, badges, a special hat. Has a “regal” aspect.
Although Otto speaks perfect proper Eeber, is an avowed Catastrophian loyal to the Helioptic traditions and employed in the Rider complex of businesses, he has a slightly “other-worldly” character that even he cannot explain.

Personality
Self-important in a beguiling way. Comfortable dealing with “important” and “powerful” people, but capable of communicating in a sympathetic manner with folks from any station. Somewhat stand-offish with mixed folks.

Occupation
Member of the High Council of the Free Carpenters Guild, which makes him a participant in some circles of Riders governance. 

Habits/Mannerisms
An enigma in many ways. Moves as easily through meetings with Helioptic Scribes in Beshoqua as he does strolling through the mountains with the leading nobles of New Weyr or sitting through negotiations with a chatty bunch of legal-eagles in Beaverton. A popular and successful guilder heading up an important group of craftspeople, Otto is a sought-after go-between.  
Tends to drink too much, which makes him sick.

Background
His family life is a mystery to many. He has no parents or siblings in the region. There is no registration of a partnering, though he has been spending a lot of time in New Weyr visiting his friend [a wind lord]. He flirts freely with many whom he encounters and is known to have fathered several broodkins. 

His own recollection is of growing up on a farm in Rontana as part of a natural family with mild Helioptic beliefs, of his gentle parents passing away of natural causes, of various siblings and farm hands who drifted away into other trades, of learning to ride a sloebeest at a young age and entertaining fantasies of becoming a Ring Rider, of the farm passing to new tenants once Otto moved to Borded to join the carpenters. 

The truth is that he is the child of leading members of the 7th Observation Squad of the Intra-Galactic Rehabilitation Agency, star-born, moon-raised,(temporarily) memory-wiped, and injected into human society at age 12 (when he “chose to join the carpenters”) as part of an Agency program to get a closer grip on the problems they are dealing with.  He was scheduled to be recalled and debriefed but the paperwork on that has been mis-filed, so now neither the Agency nor Otto are aware of who he actually is.

Internal Conflicts
Strange recurring dreams that are difficult to make sense of, that sometimes seem to be about his youth, sometimes seem to be very specific directives.

External Conflicts
His New Weyr love affair is about to blow up when he finds out his beloved has been promised to another.

Natural parents unknown, raised in a Heliop Brood House in Rikila. 

Internal Conflicts
Feels out of place, admires the free-wheeling Kahila culture and the dignity of the Riders.
Feels uneducated and without opportunities.

External Conflicts
Doesn’t want to be cannon fodder for the Volunteers, nor bait for the Basimi.

Physical Description
Skinny, often hungry

Personality
Rebel-without-a-cause. Drawn towards drink and intoxicants. Peforms genders alternatingly just to annoy authority. 

Occupation
Butcher’s apprentice.

Habits/Mannerisms
Bit of a grifter. Always looking for a prank or a scam. Amusing to other youth, not so much with the Day Watch.

Background
Natural parents were a Guard and a meat-merchant. Raised in a Brood House in Rikila.

Internal Conflicts
Deeply dissatisfied with status quo but doesn’t understand how to get out of it. Dreams of being a celebrity like Birakay but doesn’t have the discipline to learn the bardsongs.

External Conflicts
Several run-ins with the Watch. If not careful will be drafted into the Border Volunteers.

Wild hair, big everything. Female presentation.

Personality
Big

Occupation
Visitors guide and occasional farm hand

Habits/Mannerisms
Enjoys telling the story of Morning Thunder and New Harvest. 

Background
Raised by an herbalists family in the Weyrlands.

Internal Conflicts
As much as she likes New Harvest and her job, Zadane is intensely curious about the other provinces and resents somewhat being “kept down on the farm”.

External Conflicts
She stumbles into a cave one day, discovering the entrance to Freedom. Somewhat appalled to learn that the elders keep secrets from the collective, and that the nature of those secrets (the weapons- and flight-related aspects) may contradict widely-held Herbalist and Barbasol pacifistic views.

            <Text>Calley Coola
Older than the Hills • Ingar

Role in Story
A dose of cynical realism.  The chorus.  A line of sight into the Town of Ingar and the area where Saskan &amp; Lewshan lands meet  — foggy, mysterious, hard to fathom. 

Goal
Minor character. Something like comic relief, but in a negative way. Zizikian humor. Also helps to establish where the Enclosure is located, why so little is known outside of the Saskan area.  

Physical Description
Prone to wearing cloaks, dark clothes, gloves, boots, big hats, masks of various kinds. Tall, a bit bent over sometimes. 

Personality
Doom and gloom all the time.

Occupation
Who knows?  Some people say CC sells sea shells, but nobody is quite sure why.  Presumed by most to be part of the (so-called) “Mages Guild”.

Habits/Mannerisms
Full of cynical observations prior to the events of the story.  Participates in organizing resistance to shadowy monstrous invasions from Lewshan, while at the same time speculating on what kinds of pain and suffering the Lewshananan “mists” drive them to such extremes.  Full of cynical observations after the events of the story.
Able to disappear into the shadows and the mist as needed.

Background
Came to Imgur (uh, really?, Imgur?) from the Lewshan Hills. Knows much more about that area than lets on. Is convinced that the out-of-control “hunger” that lurks in the “shadows” will one day overwhelm the Saskan Lands, no matter which “theory of song” wins the day.  Expects the Lewshan monsters will destroy the world, no matter what the Agency does.

Internal Conflicts
The usual ones for a Cassandra. No one ever listens. 

External Conflicts
Unpopular with the Helioptic Authority.  Always on the Watch List.

Undeterminable • All over then place

Role in Story
Like CC, a bit of a villain, a bit of the Chorus, a little bit of Approaching The Mystery. A Muse.

Goal
Inject another level of complexity into the overall orchestration:  a rebel from the Agency, a “fallen angel”. 

Physical Description
Similar to CC but more flamboyant, with larger and more varied hats, more spectacular boots, cloaks and gowns that float about even when there is not wind.  

Personality
Utterly contrary to all accepted wisdoms. Contradicts pretty much everything anybody says regarding “the ways things are” and so forth.  Expresses a lot of sympathy for the creatures of the Lewshan and for the “imprisoned and manipulated” Jaxen.   Likes to tell Saskan folks that they live in a prison or a zoo and they don’t realize it.  
Friend, possibly lover, to Calley Coola. 

Occupation
Widely considered to be something like a “witch” and a member of the so-called “Mages Guild”, Basically she is an anarchist. 
Took some tech with her upon exit from the Agency that allows her to travel very quickly and gives her clothes that “floaty” look.  Yes, her “scooter” might be interpreted as something like a broomstick…
Spends a good bit of energy just avoiding being arrested, since she generally stirs up trouble wherever she goes.  Is known as a purveyor of &quot;gemstones&quot; that have “magical” properties, such as helping with healing or allowing for communications over long distances. 

Habits/Mannerisms
Loves to dance.  Likes to organize groups into something called “Purple Parties” who help to organize presentations of “The Antelope Dance”.  (See The Story of the Hill People’s Dance). Fond of outrageous characters and seeks them out, often being the instigator but not the executioner of various wild schemes. 

Background
Jesse K was recruited by the Agency at a young age, given various kinds of training and then went “AWOL” when learning of the real picture regarding the Enclosure, the Monitoring and so on.  Believes that the Enclosure should be destroyed and the various creatures allowed to find their own destiny without interference from the Agency.  

Has a kind of coven-leader relationship with 3M. 

Internal Conflicts
Similar to CC, feels like nobody listens to her warnings and her advice. 

External Conflicts
Constantly on the run from authorities, especially the Heliopses, but the Riders and others are not terribly fond of her either.  Herbalists are as likely as Heliopses to condemn her as a “bad influence”.

            <Text>Cereb
Newborn • Scatterling

Role in Story
Re-introduces the reality of flight into the cultural context of the Saskan Lands.

Through flight and internal narrative, get a different perspective on things and help to tie things together, while (re-)introducing a &quot;lost&quot; element of reality in the Enclosure. 

The birth of Cereb should read and proceed as a challenge to the Agency's supremacy -- as the beginning of the opening of the Enclosure.  Perhaps we end the story with Cereb breaking free of the Enclosure?

Goal
Don't entirely steal the &quot;mother of dragons&quot; motif.  In this case Cereb is her/him/itself a sentient being -- but unlike most of the characters is more animal in appearance than human.

Physical Description
Much on the bird side. Does not look or act like a &quot;dragon&quot; except perhaps in some allusions to the mythical phoenix.

            <Text>Remanj Jexan
19 • village of Unnaghobik in Salotriza, off the road between Mizry and Hadika

Role in Story
Perspective of a poor farmer's family caught up in the winds of war

Goal
Show interactions with some of the main characters from the POV of one who feels all the suffering of the age and is not invested in any of the existing ideological solutions.  Is not fond of music.

Physical Description
Long curly red hair. Silver eyes. 

Personality
Perceived as somewhat sneaky and deceptive, the result of his difficult upbringing and fears regarding his parents' disappearance.

Powers
Mild empathetic sort of telepathy -- can pretty accurately detect fear, anxiety, lying and their opposites if he can look a client in the eyes. Likely inherited from one of his parents.  (This may be part of why they disappeared.)

Occupation
Apprenticed to a small but reknowned &quot;Downer&quot; (psychiatric/psychological care) unit in his village serving mainly Helioptic and Rider military units stationed in the region, particularly those returning from the northern and eastern borderlands.  The unit is led by legendary scanner Rollo of the Dexelites.

Member of a small local &quot;Restorationist&quot; cult called the Nightingales.  Their banner is a Red Bird on a white background. 

Occasionally gathers info on commission from the Scanners Detecting Agency of Two Trees, sometimes looking for infiltrators from Lewshanana, but more often a less dire nature.
Habits/Mannerisms
Can read and write proper Eebar. Speaks with a lilting Salotrizan accent. 
Knows some Eebarq and can understand Oober.
Most prized possession is a drawing of his natural parents, who vanished when he was 12.
His closest companion is a natural (non-enhanced-sentience) dog named Fluke.
Skilled at knife-throwing.

Background
Two brothers: Novarick (younger) and Nabalon (older), both poor farmers in the village eking out a living on the land left by their parents.

Internal Conflicts
Nabalon accused Remanj of being responsible for their natural parents' disappearance, a false accusation that still hurts.

External Conflicts
Drawn into adventuring by wanderers from the Weyrlands when he was 14-ish, Remanj has been all the way to New Weyr and back and is aware, to some degree of the great conflict that is about to erupt in the eastern lands.  Anxious to set up a new operation closer to the front, where there are sure to be plenty of troubled clients, but Rollo is not sure Remanj is ready for and the relationship between the 3 siblings, already troubled, may suffer further.

Role in Story
Provide an alternative to the Heliop and Rider narratives.  Help to &quot;open the door&quot; of the Enclosure from a &quot;Restorationist&quot; POV.   Rollo is committed to investigating and using &quot;ancient knowledge&quot; of the healing arts in service to the Saskan communities.

            <Text>Dex and Biff
19 • New Weyr, Rikila

Role in Story
Always nice to have some kind of twisty twins tale to play around with... in this case, helps to tell the &quot;tale of two cities&quot; with respect to Rikila -- that den of popular uprisings and conspiracies -- and New Weyr -- those virtuous &quot;Wind Riders&quot; who fancy themselves the true elite of the Saskan Lands.  

Goal
Through their strange entanglement, reveal something of the east-west dialectic to this story, with a potential for &quot;synthesis&quot; when the two of them finally meet, work thru their personal anger and conflicts, to maybe find some kind of approach to not only settling the old mis-perceptions, but finding a way to merge the Old Rebellion and the New Way... 

Physical Description
Twin boybeks, but unknown to each other, having been separated at a young age. 

Personality
Dex is a member of a &quot;Wind Rider&quot; unit responsible mainly for patrolling the hills to insure villagers are safe from wild Fons and on the lookout for incursions from the Krunkinotto.  He seeks glory and is a bit of a shit-head. He is quite strong and very quick, to his credit, but without a lot of fortitude.  Good in an encounter, but not on a long march.  Despite his tendency to tire out fairly quickly, he has a strong constitution and tends to heal quickly when hurt.

He's never been examined and claims to be 100% bek, but is sometimes (usually jokingly) called &quot;Dex the Cat&quot; etc. by his comrades.  His foresight and perception are quite sharp -- indeed, he has slight powers of heightened hearing and seeing, with a mild ability to foresee possibilities clearly -- although he doesn't himself realize these are enhanced powers.  

His twin brother, called Biff, is similar in all ways, but has lived most of his life in Rikila, falling in with a number of basami outfits there and making a living mostly as a very successful cat-burgler, and running a number of confidence schemes as well. 


Occupation


Habits/Mannerisms


Background
During the initial Wind Rider interventions in Rikila, Dex is sent with an advanced team to scope things out. They arrive in an official capacity to parlay with the various factions and thus were quite visible to watching eyes of all types.  Biff picks up on their similar appearance and begins to use this as a means to carry out various cons.  Following complaints from locals, Biff is eventually arrested by Wind Rider agents and taken to New Weyr under guard for judgement by the &quot;royal&quot; court.  This is how Dex and Biff are re-united.

            <Title>Comrades of the Old Mill Cooperative</Title>
            <Text>A group of “hill country” people, from the villages and towns of The Weyrlands, Eelan and Bordaloon who work at a mill grinding flour, corn and other grains.  The mill is powered by a water wheel on the upper Blue, about two keys east of the main north-south path connecting the 3 provinces. 
They are a combination of mixed and non-mixed sentients, all fully human in appearance. 
As part of the work they do producing flours, for baking, brewing and for mixing s’lah, they interact with a number of guilds, inns, breweries, brooder-homes and other enterprises throughout the western provinces and into the center, especially the Towns of Qurol and Bordakal.  They are major suppliers to the Festival of the Full Moons.
The Mill itself is connected in a larger syndicate to a series of farms along the Upper Blue. This is the foundation for a political movement that has a certain degree of support in New Weyr, Eelan Town and Mabhakol that might be called “Rider Syndicalism” or the “Free Riders Movement”.   The Mill workers collective and the broader syndicate are heavily infiltrated by the Circle of Fives, a more or less revolutionary organization with ties to various movers-and-shakers like the chaos-anarchy of Jesse K, certain elements of the Reform Movements in Beavertoon and the Isle of Wye, some New Weyr “royalists”, and certain more-or-less “mystical” organizations centered around New Harvest and Barbol.   
Along with their regular work and their occasional forays into politics, the Old Mill Comrades live in a sort of large extended family, with children being raised collectively for the most part. They also take pride in putting on a show at the Festival, prior to the Dance.  This is usually a funny musical number.  
The Mill Workers tend to specialize in various skills as part of their production work, and as producers of the show for the Festival, but these roles are fluid and it is not unusual for them to change over time. The roles include, but are not limited to:
* Grinder — overseeing the running and maintenance of the grinding wheel
* Winnower — prepare the various grains for grinding
* Packager — make, mend and fill bags and crates for delivery
* Runner — handle communications with farmer-producers and with customer-consumers
* Dealer — usually the more senior members, arrange barter or cash transactions, handle financial affairs / business relationships / recruitment
* Elder -- usually hold other roles too; responsible for handling conflicts within the group and for some aspects of instruction/training of new members, children
The members address each other using a collection of words like “comrade” that have the sense of “camarada” and “comadre” or “copadre” and “compadre”, which is to say, “bed-fellow”, “co-mother”, “co-father”, “good-friend” and so on and typically follow that with a role title, using a proper name only needed to distinguish a difference.
When preparing or putting on a show, they use role-names associated with that work rather than with mill work.  So this would be something like “Dear Elder Friend of the Lighting”,  “Co-Parent of the Costumes”, and so on.  Gender specification is fluid and can be vague, as in most cultures of the western provinces, but not strictly codified, as in the central provinces.

            <Title>Independent Healers Association</Title>
            <Text>IHA
Clinics in all major towns and some villages

Role in Story
An outpost of calm, healing and something like science. How characters get put back together after violent episodes.

Relationship to Other Organizations
Tend to remain neutral between large tribal organizations

Description
A service organization, they are funded in part by town offices since they provide a necessary role. Also take donations and volunteers. 

Roles of Members
Organized in something like a meritocratic hierarchy, with titles and gowns/banners/hats somewhat reminiscent of medieval universities, with an overlay of religious community garb. 

Prime Healers — top of the hierarchy, usually old and experienced, from a variety of specialties. Responsible for a certain geographic area, but travel a good bit.

Medico — basically a general practitioner. May have some skills in surgery as well. Mostly diagnoses and treatments with herbal concoctions and accupressure-type massage.

Mage Healer — rare, sints with powers of healing. Not necessarily associated with Mages Guilds.

Scanner — a mental health worker. May or may not also be a member of a “Detecting” agency

Haitchtoo — an assistant to a healer, at many levels of skill, may range from apprentices to clean-up crew. This term is said to reflect the sound a sick person makes. It may also be a legacy of an old acronym. 

Mullie — a medical researcher, more interesting in information gathering and experimentation than in treatment.  “Mulls” things over. Also a reference to the MUL.  

Currie — an independent, usually more traditional, “healer”, more common South of the Barbo and in the hills, often associated with an Herbalist community. Some are members of the IHA and some are not. 

Types/Personalities of Members
Often thoughtful, almost monk-like, but some are gregarious and a bit crude.

Industrial, Economic or Cultural Role


Habits/Dress / Mannerisms of Members
Their symbol is a red dot or sphere. The number of dots reflects their role in the Association. More dots means higher-up.  
The obvious association here is with drops of blood. The IHA — though this is not widely known — was initiated by Agents with strong ties to the Martian Underground Labs (MUL), but that is a whole other story…

Background


Internal Conflicts
Some IHA members with a strong agricultural background are interested in evolution and genetics research. They have begun to suspect that the variations in geno/pheno in the Saskan Lands are not entirely natural. This exacerbates some of the existing humo/puro vs. mixed-sint conflicts that rattle pretty much all Saskan communities. 

External Conflicts
The Bugs have tried infiltrating the IHA from time to time in order to gather info on sint bio-chemistry and so on. They are generally unsuccessful as the Medicos are quite good at spotting Jaxen. 
Some parts of the Agency occasionally try to interfere as well, especially in work looking into evolution and genetics, though this itself has internal conflicts due to the IHA ties to the MUL.

Indeterminate • many

Role in Story
Some comic relief, but also a mystery.

Goal
To serve. And to spy for the (Created) (aka the Cloned). We will call them the Bugs or Hempties in common tongue. 

Physical Description
Human-like with a limited vocabulary in most cases.

Personality
Follows routine scripts in most cases. Not many realize that they have something of a hive mind.

Occupation
Most of employed as servers at inns, but also found in other menial tasks.
Sometimes employed as “red shirts” on quests/missions.

Habits/Mannerisms
Somewhat obsequious, generally humble. Appear/disappear without notice.

Background
Sent down from the bases of the Created in the Krunkinotto Mountains to infiltrate organic society,
a Jax has a minimalist pre-built memory reflective of the environment they are sent into. 
They are one model of cloned being. Others are considerably more dangerous. The main purpose of a Jax is to collect info and report back to the main nodes. 

Internal Conflicts
Conflicting directions or complex philosophical questions can mess with a Jax’s programming, causing kernel panic and other types of crashes.  Their empathy AI components are the source of numerous fuzzy outcomes; some Jaxen can become very attached to specific organic life-forms.

External Conflicts
Most Jaxen eventually come to realize that they are not human and this can cause existential crises of various kinds. Generally, the central nodes recall them once their AI reaches this point of complexity. In rare cases, a Jax will resist being recalled; this can lead to a shutdown unit being sent to close them down. Some organic forms have a deep antipathy towards the Created and have no compunction about crashing or (in rare cases) re-programming a Jax.  The Agency is aware of the Jax problem but, along with a reluctance to interfere too much in planetary affairs, has not yet developed a virus or similar malware strong enough to penetrate the Code of the Created.

Notes
The Jaxen hierarchy is fairly large. Specialized varieties exist. But almost all are either humo-like or insect-like. In the Home Caves, Control sometimes takes on the form of giant Spiders or Centipedes. There are quite a few generations, patches and releases. Older versions continue to function for some time in most cases, except when there has been some kind of major system problem. (see Release 4.0, for example)

The manufacturing systems of the Created are called, generically, the System. The command-and-control system which links most Jaxen together is usually called either Control or The Web. 

Releases, upgrades, patches follow standard Unix-style numbering and major release also receive code names relating mostly to Order Hemiptera (”True Bugs”). 

1.x.x  “Water Boatmen”
Jaxen 1.0.0 were mainly designed to infiltrate the waterways, primarily in insect form, with some very rudimentary humo versions, typically very small.
1.2.0, called “Back Swimmers”, took on the shape, in some cases, of small boats

2.x.x  “Water Bugs” or “Belos” and “Light Bugs”
Jaxen 2.0 included submersibles for the first time.
2.3.0, called “Toe Biters” and “Light Bugs”, moved into smaller ponds and marshes, often as bottom-crawlers, where they posed some problems for fisherfolk.  
The “Light Bug” humo variety were attracted to hearths and such, which helped to replenish their energy source.  At this stage, the humo-style Jaxen had almost no verbal skills and were still very short in stature.

3.x.x  “Water Scorpions”
Jaxen 3.0.0 were longer and taller. The humo versions were somewhat more believable, though very skinny. They began to take on simple labor tasks, particular at farms and granaries.
The insect versions developed an offensive capability that allowed them to paralyze victims, usually for the purpose of bringing them back to the System for study.

4.x.x. “Toad Bugs” or “Gellies”
Jaxen 4.0.0 were not very successful and it is rare to find one still extant. First insect variety designed for land travel, they hopped and looked like small toads. 
Humo version was an attempt to fill out the form, but tended to become oddly misshapen and lumpy in a short time.

5.x.x. “Striders”
Jaxen 5.0.0 corrected the flaws in Release 4. More spherical-shaped humo bodies that did not “gel out”. 
Insect versions can skim/surf over water and come in sizes large enough to carry small loads.

6.x.x. “Bed Bugs”
Jaxen 6.0.0 were the first specialized line of humo-only machines. They are designed to be very durable, able to enter a kind of coma-state when not active and requiring very low energy levels. 
Skin is reddish. While they have multiple energy sources, they sometimes feed on small amounts of human blood. 
Behavioral modules were designed to make the units attractive to humos, but tend to come across like sluts. More or less the original ho’s of the Jaxen world, they were designed mainly to gather information on how to infiltrate humo communities. Often subject to abuse and jokes.

7.x.x. “Plant Bugs” or “Miris”
Jaxen 7.0.0 are very specialized insect-style machines. They emulate the shape and feel of various plants, but are also mobile to some degree — usually moving very slowly. 
They are deployed primarily as information-gathering devices.
Jaxen 7.4.0 are called “Assassins”. A more highly developed form of the “Scorpion Bugs”, they move about more quickly and conceal a potent paralyzing stinger.  Once an Assassin has immobilized its prey, then typically either humo-Jaxen or Striders are called in to take it away to the Home Caves.
Jaxen 7.13.0 are called “Ambush Bugs”. Having even more advanced camouflage than other Miris, they are deployed mainly in the lower hills of the Krunkinotto to defend the Jaxen caves and ward off intruders. 

8.x.x. “Seed Bugs” or “Suckers”
Jaxen 8.0.0 are the next-generation of “Bed Bugs”. Skin is glossy and much more similar to varieties of humo skin.  Instead of being blood-suckers, they are adept at sipping, umm, “nectars” from both male and female humos. 
Jaxen 8.7.0 are also capable of injecting nano-particles into humos which can be used track movements, gather bio-chemical data and, to a small extent, influence behavior.

9.x.x “Stink Bugs”
Jaxen 9.0.0 are the latest release. Most of the units referred to as “Jax” are this variety. 
Mostly humo, they are the most realistic to date, and are often employed as servants in inns, among groups of travelers, in farms and manufactories, and so on.  
They get their name due to their rudimentary digestion system, which mimics humo functioning but evacuates less often and when it does, tends to produce more gas and a stronger stench. 
Jaxen 9.3.0, which will be deployed for the first time when the Bugs attack the Northeast in earnest, are called “Soldier Bugs”. They are kind of a humo-insect cross, with shield-like armor and spines sticking out of their fore-arms. This is the first Jaxen model that can reproduce itself, with some specialized units, once disabled, then dropping eggs which quickly develop into new units, albeit smaller than the original.

Age • Location

Role in Story
Interest, background

Goal


Physical Description
One of the few highly-sentient mixed-with-human actors with a distinctly non-human appearance.  Sleeths are reptilian -- a joke on the whole &quot;reptile aliens from .. whatever&quot; thing.  Except in this case, they are actually descended from those alien-reptilian  predecessors. But are not evil or dangerous at all, just the opposite. 

They look very much like huge lizards, but with hands, feet, semi-human-looking heads.

They have their own very distinct Bar dialect that is largely indecipherable by most Oober and Eebar speakers. 
Personality
Unlike their ancestors, tho, and despite their &quot;ugly&quot; appearance, Sleeths are pacifist, pastoral, anarchic in their approach to governance, more or less the Jains -- or at least the Sikhs -- of the Saskan Lands


Occupation


Habits/Mannerisms
The &quot;Amish&quot; of the Saskan countryside. Do not embrace &quot;modern&quot; tools, ideologies or conflicts. Shy, insular, introverted, seek to avoid contact with humans and human-appearing sentients.

Background


Internal Conflicts
Concerns about &quot;sins of the fathers&quot;...  Sleeth children are taught to never mix with humans and to never, never try to pretend they are human.   They blame their ancestors for many of the worst atrocities in human history. 

External Conflicts
Considered &quot;unclean&quot; by many Heliops, the Sleeth clans are subject to cruel treatment by the more extreme elements of the Guards. Even Rider-affiliated and Eelani humans tend to recoil the first time they encounter Sleeths, thinking they are dangerous like Arns or Jacks.

Age • Location

Role in Story
Humor, bit of a take-off on Star Wars' &quot;Ewoks&quot;

Myth has it that some Devos have been able to domesticate and ride Arns and thus, they are the true &quot;wind riders&quot;.  And there is some truth to this rumor, though the details are a closely kept secret among the Devos.

They play a role in one of the great battles against the monstrous Lewshan hordes.
Goal


Physical Description
Very hairy, short people with tails.  Like the Sleeths and Arns, they are related to an extraterrestial species brought to the planet as part of the Zeldan Ascendency's attempt to reform the Agency.   (Several millienia ago, by Sakan reckoning.)

Personality
Cute and friendly to strangers.  Not as retiring as Sleeths, though still fairly stand-offish. But dangerous if challenged; they are adept with a good collection of locally-made weapons.  

They speak a pidgin of the old Devo language, Ooober and various sounds adapted from the natural environment. Some have learned to speak &quot;proper&quot; Bar for the purpose of negotiations and trade.  

Occupation


Habits/Mannerisms
Live only in remote areas, preferring forests and mining communities. Never go into towns.  They mainly live in cleverly-camouflaged underground burrows, but also sometimes in tree houses.

Background
In the case of the Devos, their ancestors were rescued from extermination on their home planet, which was suffering from planet-death brought on by ecological and civilizational collapse.  They were brought here millennia before the Heliops and Riders arrives in Saskantinon and settled peaceably in the country side, unobserved by most humans.

They may be the ones who introduce Cereb's egg into the region.

Age • Location

Role in Story
&quot;For&quot;, &quot;-fon&quot;, &quot;fonda-&quot; and similar sounding terms refer to any non-enhanced-sentient animal, especially but not only mammals.   &quot;Rep&quot; (or “Rip” or “Reep”?), etc. refers to non-sentient reptiles and amphibians of all types, including snakes, turtles and tortoises.   &quot;Fish&quot; is used to refer to any non-sentient creature that swims in the sea, lakes or rivers. 

For example, an &quot;ursafon&quot; or a &quot;fondabear&quot;  describes a bear that doesn't have any enhanced capabilities.

There are also plenty of non-sentient worms, ants, centipedes, millipede and other (non-flying) insects and spiders. Bees, butterflies, mosquitos, moths, flies, wasps and hornets are extinct in the Enclosure, which is why there are so many herbalists and farmers who spend time pollinating plants and distributing seeds by hand.  &lt;— This should be brought up early and be a key focus of describing the Southern lifestyle.
Goal


Physical Description
Animals I expect to see in the story... (likely more)... with some variations from our norms in some cases
(Dometicated and feral) dogs and cats
Horses

Mostly farmers, some miners and craftspeople. Trade in minerals creates enough wealth to sustain something like a Terrapin Welfare Network and is also used to hire song-catchers.

            <Title>Mantemar</Title>
            <Text>Mantemar names the Enclosure. It is like a collection of Continents and some very large islands, but beyond it is only The Edge of the World. The name “Mantemar” refers to fact that all land is surrounded by the world-ocean. “Mantemar” is used in the sense of “the world” as well as of “the ocean”.  

In this world, there is a widely-held belief that the lands and lives of Mantemar are “enclosed” by a higher power or powers.  Sun-worshippers center this belief in a power residing in the Sun, while so-called Moons-worshippers center their beliefs in powers residing away from the Sun, such as in the Two Moons, in the Wanderers (planets), in various configurations of Stars, or in the Beyond. 

A smaller set of believers state that life and existence is itself literally an illusion in the sense that some greater power has imagined, dreamed or somehow caused to come into self-consciousness the lands and beings of Mantemar. 

A variation on that belief is a materialist version which considers that the lands and lives of Mantemar are some kind of experiment being conducted by unknown forces outside of the Enclosure.  

This last belief is closest to the truth. In fact, the planet experienced a bad case of the Catastrophicals and nearly wrecked itself. As in so many other cases, the Agency had to come along and do some engineering to rehabilitate the place. These “evolutionary” tweaks, initiated thousands of years ago, were intended to help prevent the worst outbreaks of catastrophe from happening again.  So you see the effects of strong constraints in place on burning fossil fuels, on letting inter-species imbalances go too far, on rapid transit and long-range communications, and on over-population. And some seeming imbalances in speciation too, like very few flying things, as well as some mutations and variations that were not designed so much as allowed to proceed. 


Mantemar contains several large land masses. Our story takes place (for now) only on the northern land mass referred to as Lurabar.  For most of the characters in our story, little is known of the lands of Lurabar outside of the Saskantinon, and virtually nothing of the lands beyond the sea.

There are two islands of considerable size — they could even be considered small continents —  to the east of Lurabar. The first is Pentacross and the second Greenstrand. North of Pentacross is the cold and icy island of Bir, the northernmost land. To the west of Lurabar are a group of four islands, plus three more small islands much further west, actually closer to Mudhook than to the other islands in this group.  While three of these islands are quite sizable, none are anywhere near as large as those to the East. They are called, collectively, The Firelands.  

The largest land mass in the world lies to the south of Lurabar; it is called Bricot.  South of Bricot lies the southernmost land of Mantemar, a nearly uninhabitable land frozen in ice.  Some legends say that the frozen land of Rikondo passes beyond the Enclosure, that is, beyond the Edge of the World, but none of whom we know have ever traveled there and back again.  A sizable island to the west of Bricot is called Mudhook. Two smaller islands to the east of Bricot’s thinning peninsular eastern extension, well to south of Pentacross and Greenstrand, are called, collectively, Asterlorn. 


Between Lurabar’s Krbshanana Peninsula, Bricot northeastern shore, and to the southwest of Pentacross lie a collection of islands, some a bit larger, some quite small, scattered over hundreds of klicks of ocean. These, along with several of the extruberances along the southern cost of the Forg (southeastern Luramar), and an island just off the eastern coast of Luramar, bordering the Realms of the Shanowa, are referred to collectively as The Remari, which can be loosely translated as “holes in the ocean”.  Some parts of our story take place there.

            <Title>Ring Road</Title>
            <Text>Ring Road

A road that circles through the central lands of Saskantinon.  The major and minor paths that track close to it. 

The Ring Road and the location of paths, towns, regions, villages, hills, caves, hide-outs, secrets, underground caverns and so forth in relationship to them provide a harmonic framework for the story-telling.

The Ring is a core metaphor for the world of Mantemar, and of Saskiniton in particular.  It  features in myth, legend and song.

The Ring provides provides a mechanism for the development story arcs as characters explore and travel around and about it. 

Some of the key players trace a kind of passion play as they travel around the ring as members of the Riders Guild or other groups and organizations. 

I hope to make effective use of musical similes and metaphors loosely aligned to the metaphor of the Ring — key signatures, major and minor, the circle of fifths and so on — as way to develop stories and to enable and engender game play.

Related Themes

The circular, spiral nature of the game world is reflected in the physicality of the ring road.

The two rivers that circumscribe the ring roads provide a source of harmonic tones and melodies against the repeated instrumentation and chorus of the ring. If the ring is percussion and string instruments, then perhaps the rivers are woodwinds and flutes. 
Season

Let’s evoke classic views of the towns and rivers as seen from the roads. A visual “body of knowledge” maps the region in players’ minds.

Unique Features

Its history is buried in layers upon layers.

The looping circularity of the Ring Road has a metaphysical character. “It doesn’t go anywhere, but it covers everything.” 

Description

The Ring Road is largely paved. Although the materials are uneven they are have been worn to a smooth surface by the passage of countless generations of travellers. Going from points ‘A’ to ‘F’ on the Ring should evoke a certain kind of feeling. I won’t literally call this a scale, but that’s the kind of feelings I want to evoke, sometimes grand and happy, sometimes somber and sad. 

The minor roads and paths which criss-cross the Ring are sometimes paved, sometimes not. Smaller paths may be barely discernible.  These diversions may represent half-steps, sharps and flats, and provide the means for traveling along other “scales” that provide for different tones and nuances of feeling.

The Ring Road connects most of the main towns of the region. The lesser roads — the minor roads and paths — weave in and out from the great road, connecting the remaining towns and villages to the whole. 

The Ring itself is referred to in various ways … the Ring, the Passing, the Way, the Riders Realm, the 14 Towns, and more. 

Lands inside the major ring are referred to as Inner Sanskan, or the Skantaring, or by the names of the forests that make up most of its interior.   Those outside of it have a more diverse character, with each region most typically referred to by their own names and peculiarities. General terms for areas within the Lands of Saskantinon but outside of the Ring include Outer Saskan, Uiterring, the Frontier, and so on.
Sights

A traveler on the Ring Road sees signs of varying degrees of obscurity in a large variety of languages.  And all sorts of folks. Beggars. Travellers. Riders. Pilgrims. Night Watch and Day Watch.  Bandits, Thieves, Bards, Actors.   

The Ring Road attracts admirers of its antiquity, of its harmony, of its role in tying together the diverse constituencies of Saskantinon and binding them together against outside influence and threats.  
Sounds

Songs and tales of all kinds arise from the Ring.  Marching songs. Travelling songs and chants.  The rumble and movements of carts and oddly-shaped vehicles add an irregular syncopation to the more regular hoof-beats of those who ride mounts, drive herds or wear boots.  Every imaginable (name them) kind of musical instrument and voice.

 Less regular are reports of “sightings” of the legendary conveyances and bands said to have once travelled the ring, such as…

… the Shiny Chrome Train carrying the Irate Monarch — a long-gone but-not-forgotten ornery ruler of these realms who is said to have travelled in ring in sumptuous style. 

… the Flying Chariot of Airman Hector

… the Legions of the Reto Chair

… Charlie, who will come round again to restore to Metropolitan Charter

…and so forth and so on. 
Smells

Roadside inns, barkers and food merchants.  Smelly travellers.  Camp fires.  Gatherings and camps.

            <Title>Heliopticon</Title>
            <Text>The Heliopticon
Role in Story
The main political entity within the land of Saskantinon, the Heliopticon — also referred to as the Watchtower of the Sun, the All-Seeing Eye, and so forth — is a theocratic bureaucracy that is both benign and malignant. It sponsors numerous social and economic and military organizations and institutions.  It advocates for and promotes an elevated role for non-mutated human beings within the social order, and within that, promotes a “traditional” type of familial hierarchy within its faithful cohorts as well — though not of the type that we are familiar with. 
The hierarchy serves to enshrine the authority of a select group of elites, mainly men who follow a certain type of ascetic lifestyle. They guard their technological advantages carefully, play on human fears of sentient-animals, and do so in the context of a doctrine focussed on Sun-worshipping metaphors.
The Heliopticon is a bit of a Rorschach test.  It is ia convenient kind of target for rebel story-lines, and certainly plays a major role in that sense.  But there is a sentimental-nostalgic aspect as well, drawing on multiple monotheistic themes that will be familiar to many players and readers. It is not the unreconstructed “evil empire” a la Star Wars.  For one thing, it is on a much smaller scale.  It is more like a national entity that has a troubled past and include many dicey characters, but also feels “like home” to many.
Key Features
The Heliocastrophical power which governs the Heliopticon is not only pro-human, it has an overt bias against re-shaped or modified humans, as well as against fully-shaped (cloned, android) entities, and against both fully-sentient animals and  manifestations of animal-human mixes. The most fundamentalist of the Heliops favor a 'return' to what they perceive as a 'pure' humanity.  

Helioptic science promotes a Sun-centered view of the universe that rejects ideas identifying the Sun as one star amongst many.  Some fundamentalist Heliops tend to be deeply opposed to vegetarianism, which they take to be a sign of pro-animalism, and to star-gazing or astronomy more generally, which they take as a sign of feeble-mindedness.  In the Heliocrastic cosmology, the stars are simply holes in the night canopy. Their light — obviously — comes from the Sun.  Less-sophisticated Heliops also tend to be superstitious about ‘evil forces’ which they understand to be emanating from the Two Moons.  

The Heliopticon is a militarized theocracy that frowns upon heresy and apostasy, and is willing to take violent actions to defend its privileges and its ideology.  It lacks a preponderance of public support and does not have a monopoly on either force or technology. Nevertheless it provides both physical and economic security for many humans in its realm of influence, and successfully benefits from the propaganda of fear it regularly promotes.   A less-obvious role of the Heliopticon is that its family social policy provides for a very controlled means of population growth. As we learn as the story unfolds, this is no accident. 

The general feeling promoted by the Heliops needs to be more like “Here Comes the Sun” than “Deutschland Uber Alles”, but it is a smile that masks a tension.  The “Gleaming” needs to come across in the way that witch-burning or heretic-burning must have seemed to pre-modern societies — that it is a protection against “evil” and even a (gory) kind of entertaining spectacle. 

Despite the intention and desires of Heliops, the Land of Two Rivers is quite diverse both genetically and ideologically. The power of the Heliocastron, as the high offices of the Heliopticon are called, and its many watchers, specialists, agents, officers and other minions is far from total. The region seethes with intrigue, contrariness and revolutionary sentiments, as well as more open and less dire types of counter-veiling forces, from the agro-feminists of New Harvest  (Freedom) to the busy beavers of Beavertoon to the Riders of Borded, and more. 

Some of the towns and villages in the region have a large degree of autonomy from the Offices of the Heliocastron, though these types of situations are seldom without their troubles.

            <Title>Saskantinon</Title>
            <Text>Saskantinon
Role in Story

(I am not thrilled with “Saskantinon”.  It is OK and I don’t hate it. But it doesn’t resonate with the undertones of musicality I’d like to introduce. Considering “Arpeggia” and “Fretonia” as  alternatives.) 

Located in the south-central region of Lurabar, east of the mountains of Krunkinotto and Aranzen, and west of the Jezidi'ivv River and the Krbsh Sea. In reference to the two rivers which flow through it, the Bloo and the Barbo, the Land of Saskantinon is also called The Land of the Two Rivers or variations on the names of the rivers, like Barbo-Bloo, Bloobar, Barbloo and so on.

The region is also referred to as the Saskan Lands, the Ringtoons (LOL - love this), the Saskantoons, the Rivertoons and various other names associated with notable aspects of its character in a synecdochel fashion, referring to the whole by reference to a part: 
	•	Jook — an ancient name, one of the oldest inhabited areas of the region
	•	Heliocastria — referring to the Helioptic powers that claim to rule the region
	•	Barbo — after the southern river and some of the sub-regions and towns 
	•	Bloorio — after the northern river and some of the sub-regions and towns
	•	Bordal or Borded — after the important Rider town of Borded
	•	Besquo or Beshkwoo — after the important Helioptic town of Besquohuk  

(Most of these names need work.)

Both rivers originate in the western mountains and flow into the Krbsh Sea. The southern river, the Barbo, drains into the Great Beaver Lake, created by the formidable dams built by the inhabitants of Beavertoon.  Along with its natural course into the Krbsh Sea, now by way of Beaver Lake, the Barbo also drains into, also by way of Beaver Lake, and provides navigation to, the Bay of Bar to the south. And there is a navigable canal that ties Beaver Lake to the Lake of Oo, near the border with the animal-ruled Syndicate of Krbshanana.  

For now, most of the action in the story and the game takes place within the Lands of Saskantinon. 

Importance of the Rivers
Just as the Ring Road ties together Saskan lands, provides a good bit of its security, energizes its commerce and ties together its diverse peoples and sentients, so the Two Rivers bring a flow of life into the region that goes beyond the obvious benefits of navigation, trade, fishing and irrigation. 

[Not thrilled with “Bloo” and “Barbo”. Again, something with more of a musical allusion would be nice. 
In Latin and Spanish, “barbo” resonates with “hairy” and “bearded” and “barber”. In Italian and Portuguese, with “barbel”, a type of fish. It is a family name in some traditions (Spanish? Irish?). A dog named Barbos is the star of 10 minute Russian comedic film from 1961; there is an Australian version of the story too, “The Loaded Dog”.
There is a cartoon character named Bloo. A clever, self-centered, cynical, greedy, immature villainous character. There is also a South Korean/Filipino rapper (in Los Angeles) in crew “42” called Bloo (Daniel Kim Hyunwoong).
It would be nice to have an etymology of river names that makes some kind of sense, maybe has some musical resonance, and doesn’t have any (undesired) negative allusions.
Not too big on the “Bighott” river either.]

The northern river, the Bloo, runs from the northwest to the east through northern Saskantinon. It originates in two main feeder-tributaries.  One, the Borbloo, originates in the Krunkinotto mountains.  The other tributary, the Weybloo, flows through the foothills of western Weyrlands, in an unnavigable but beautiful, entrancing series of mild waterfalls that goes on for miles and miles before reaching the rapids of Eelan and then the Mabhakol Falls, just before it flows under the Ring to join the Borbloo to form the Bloo.  While the Bloo  sustains a great deal of life in the Heliopticon it also brings with it river pirates and other challenges flowing down from the Krunki northlands and the western hills.  As a result  of such traffic the Bloo is almost as heavily patrolled by Helioptic and other Saskantinonian forces as is the Ring Road.

The southern river, the Barbo, originates in the hills where the wild western Weyrlands beyond the borders of Saskantinon merge into those of northern Aranzen, a largely human-run region to the southwest of the Saskan lands.  Legends, tales, traditions, songs and traditional sentiments of the region describe the Barbo as the lifeblood of the Bar-speaking regions of Saskantinon, Aranzen and Krbshanana.  Some traditions sing of it as the earth-soul and treat it as an object of veneration and even worship, similar to how the Weybloo is treated by some westerners.  In a demographic and pragmatic sense, the Barbo — along with the southern part of the Ring Road, marks the line between the largely human and human-appearing populations to the north of the river and the largely animal and mixed animal-human populations to its south, particularly in the Saskan region of Uitibarbo, bordering the Realm of the Komexenon, and the marshy region of Oobar, north of the Syndicate of the Krbshanana. 

Banks of the Rivers
As they flow through the Ringtoons, the Bloo and the Barbo mark both geographic and political divides. Only in the area around Beaver Lake do the same sub-regional language and cultural and economic norms appear on both banks of the Barbo.  As with the Ring Road, the two rivers serve as both boundary and transport; they provide a dividing-line as well as a common thread.  

A Ride Down the Bloo

A boat trip on the Bloo would start in one of two places.  Just east of the falls at Markbhol, near the delightful town of Qirol, just inside the Ring, where the Weybloo first expands into a navigable stream, not too long before it joins the Bloo proper. Or to the northwest of the fortified town of Borded, perhaps as far as the border of the Saskan Lands where the waters of the Borbloo spill dramatically down from the heights of the Krunkinotto Hills, rushing into the southern plains, where it forms a porous border between the two Rider-dominated regions of mountainous Bordaloon and the windswept plains Mabalbesq.  

The first great architectural site one would see would be Borded, the largest and one of the grandest towns Saskantinon, home of the powerful Riders Guild. The Borbloo passes directly past its elaborate walls, passing under the Ring Road at the Paladin Bridge near Borded’s impressive Southern Gate.  A winding and difficult river to navigate, one would still be steering very carefully as the Borbloo passes through the hills of southern Salofess before merging into the more peaceful, if considerably wider, Bloo. 

Continuing eastward, now well into the realm of the Heliocastron, on the right-hand, starboard, southern bank of the Bloo, sailors and their crew and passengers would see first the forests of the Borda Woods and then, after passing the richly appointed militaristic Helioptic town of Sungyte, the rich farmlands of Rotonabloo all along the riverbank for miles on end. Such bucolic scenes continue all the way to the grand town of Khaliro, a major Helioptic trading center, and then go on again for many more until reaching the town of Rutonik, where the Ring once again crosses the Bloo as it heads south towards the dense forests of Kahilibarbakal.  

The north, on the left-hand, portside bank of the Bloo, a similar but sparser and starker agricultural vista unfolds for the river-borne voyager traveling past Borded, Sungyte, Khaliro and Rútonik. The province of Jivákala, between the Bloo and the Ring, is home to major Helioptic military encampments. But they are far from the river, not visible to river travelers. What they would see from the boat are villages, farms, small encampments, and vast fields of grain for harvest and forage for beasts — a peaceful scene belying its purpose, which is to feed to Day Watch, the Night Watch and the Volunteers — the armed forces of the Heliocastron. 

Passing under the Bridge of Trees just east of Rútonik, voyagers on the river Bloo experience a distinct sense of passage as they move into the borderlands of Eebar.  These Saskan Lands face off  towards the Lewshanana delta to their north and east, feeding into the immense Gray Forest of the Jezidi’ivv River basin and beyond that, the startlingly imposing sentinels of the Lewshan Peaks, where, it is said, many monsters dwell. On a clear day, an observant traveller who’d thought to bring a looking-glass could see, away to the northeast, the tree line of the Gray Forest where it quickly deepens and darkens as it approaches the north-eastern border of Saskantinon with the Lewshan Lands, marked by the Jezidi'ivv River.    

After Rútonik, the Bloo widens considerably. Its traffic takes on a considerably busier, more mixed and cosmopolitan character, with traffic arriving from the Krbsh Sea and moving upriver to trade with the Saskantoons. The town of Ingar in the province of Eebar is the last mainland outpost of Saskan civilization a seaborne traveler sees before the Bloo merges with the Jezidi'ivv to pour into the Lewshanana Delta on the northern end of the Krbsh Sea. Assuming a traveller were then to voyage on into the Sea, they’d see the great tower of the Port of Blubar, which overlooks the massive Delta, guarding the entry into Saskantinon from the sea. If they continued south, hugging the coast, they might also see the smaller tower of the Port of Selaron in the Outer Ring province of Mobalbesq, and even further to south, they’d encounter the mouth of the Barbo, where it separates the Mobalbesq from the Isle of Wye. And here they would have definitively left the northern Eebar-speaking lands, characterized politically by collaboration between the Riders Guild and the Heliops, both organizations run by and for the benefit of human-appearing-humans, and entered the Oobar-speaking Saskan lands, where things are a bit different.

A Ride Down the Barbo

Our traveller who had set out from the Krunkinotto borderlands north of Borded, if they had survived all the way to Selaron and beyond, might very well encounter a traveler who had also begun a river journey far to the west, but further to the south.

The Weyrlands cross over the border of Saskantinon into the Lands of the Aranzen people — a fuzzy border. The border between the Krunkinotto — itself a vague concept — and the Weyrlands is also not entirely clear.  What is well-known is that the town of New Harvest (or Freedom.. or.. ?) is nestled in the foothills of the southern Weyrlands, just north of the border — such as it is — with Aranzen. One may book passage there for a ship on the Barbo.  

Unlike the enchanting rolling rocks of the Weybloo, the Barbo is navigable starting from a point just west of (New Harvest). It gathers water from innumerable small streams as it makes its way through the Aranzen Hills. This part of the voyage is a delight.  For a reasonable amount of bits, a player can book a “cruise” through these parts just for pleasure. 

Business gets underway when the Barbo passes directly through the town of Barbol, which sits on the Ring as it turns from South to East.  On the northern, left-hand, port-side of the river, just past Barbol, are the southern end of the Borda Woods, an important part of the Helioptic heartland.  On a clear day, the Sunny banners and flags of a sizable Helioptic military encampment are visible from the river . On the right-hand, starboard, southern side of the Barbo, north of the Ring, is the province of Barboskanti (Borbaskanti ?). It is the southern equivalent of Rontonabloo (or maybe just Rontana?), a rich agricultural region densely populated with villages, farms and settlements. 

Midway to Beaver Lake, the river passes by the town of Brokilly. It sits on the northern side of the river and watches over a minor road that joins the Ring to center of Helioptic civilization:  the province of Tobaloon, a region of immense fir and pine trees, where the Helioptic Offices reside and the great town of Bequohuk is located at the geographic center of Saskantinon. Brokilly itself, however, is in the province of Kahilabek, a place inhabited mostly by Kahila folk, that has been devastated more than once by conflict between the Sunny forces and those of various uprisings and rebellions. At present, it is peaceful thanks to a kind of order imposed by the Basimi Guilds, who find that they can conduct their “business” more effectively when there is something like a “free” territory, that is not perpetually at war, in which they can operate more or less unmolested. 

Many travelers along the Barbo visit the southern side of the river to get a sense of or to dig into to rich traditions of the Barboskanti culture.  They visit the northern side, in the Kahila lands, there mostly for, ummm, shopping. 

It might seem strange to some that a territory with a reputation for being “rebel-held” borders so closely to the very seat of Helioptic power.  How this holds together is not so strange when one visits the Guards Town of Brytook, just up the road from Brokilly, or when one sees the Helioptic military encampments all along the roads from Brytook to Besquohuk.  The Tobaloon/Kahilabek borderlands are heavily fortified on the Helioptic side.

A river voyager might be justified in feeling a bit tense as they travel further along by Kahilabek province to the north, and passing along into the more remote eastern part of Barboskanti to the south. Things appear a good bit wilder on both sides of the river as one passes further away from Brokilly.  Most folks know that the wild and woolly Uitibarbo Lands are just a bit further to the south, outside of the Ring, and beyond that are the Bay of Bar and the Realm of the Komexenon, places that are nearly synonymous with “the ends of the earth” for many players, who often are just barely aware of the vast geography of Lurabar, much less what lies beyond the Seas.

Such trepidations generally come to an abrupt end when a boat floating east on the Barbo passes under the Sobright Bridge into the Land of Beavertoon. Here the river widens considerably and the land on both sides of the river erupts into activity, with unusual and entertaining sites to amuse and delight anyone who is not averse to a culture and economy dominated by folks whose DNA is obviously beaverish.  The vast majority of beaverfolk are mixed sentients. They appear similar to humans, with only some exhibiting more dramatically beaver-like physical semblances such as large flat tails. Many echo the large sometime even black and wet nose, the small mouth and small eyes of their Catoridae ancestors, but on a distinctly human frame. However, their language, culture, economy and architecture is entirely distinct from all the other regions of the Saskan Lands. 

The town of Beaverton (Castor? Castorton?) is, along with Borded and Beaquohuk, one of the three Grand Towns of the region. Like the others, it could almost be considered a city. [Come up with a vocabulary for villages, towns, cities, farms, ranches, encampments, fortified towns, and so on that reflects the varied nature of rural life especially.]  It is certainly the most unusual of the three. A traveller on the Barbo first sees the extraordinarily tall and elaborate walls and towers and artworks of Beaverton off to south, but may be forgiven for not taking notice ,since they would soon be encountering the impressive engineering feat of the Locks of Beaver Lake, a series of canals leading into the Great Beaver Lake. 

(Use terms derivative from Castor.  Castoridae/Catorinae/Castor. .. not just “beaver”) 

First time visitors might think they had reached the Krbsh Sea rather than a lake.  It is that vast. Following along the shoreline the vistor experiences the rare joy of seeing Beaverton from the water. The city simply merges into the Lake. There is no discernible shoreline. Buildings, commerce, shipping, livelihood and everyday life dissolve together into the water’s edge and continue on under and above the water.    

A voyager can navigate their boat through the city, onto the southbound canal, that stretches for many miles all the way to the Port of Barqton in the remote and boggy swampland of Oobar, on the Bay of Bar, across the canal from the easternmost reaches of Uitibarbo province. A voyager taking this route would be a brave adventurer indeed, heading towards the mysterious southern lands of Krbshanana or Komexenon. Perhaps even an “off-lander” looking to “escape the Enclosure” and travel to the fabled continent of Bricot and beyond!

More likely, they would continue east across the Beaver Lake. Either to the Wye Canal, which leads into Oo Lake and thence, through the Marshlands, to the Krbsh Sea, or through the Eastern Locks and Great Beaver Dam, continuing down the Barbo, winding their way past the Isle of Wye to the south and Mobalbesq to the north, both areas devoted largely to sea-related trade and supporting a widely mixed population. 

The Mobalbesqua town of Morilly, still a good ways from the Sea, but remarkably close via road to that other “rebel province” — the densely wooded Kahila-folk land of Kahilibarbakal — is a common stopping-off point for loading up (or off-loading) goods and supplies for transport around the point, past Selador and Ríkila, typically for trading with Oobar-speaking lands, or even into the Eastern Lands… should one be foolish enough to want to deal with the inhabitants of the Forg, or to pass through the swamps and mountains of the Lewshanana. 

Some old ballads claim that it is possible to take a boat up one of the river ways of the Forg, and navigate through them to the Sea of Song, and from thence to other civilized lands of Luramar. Have we yet met a player who has actually done so?  Well-informed Agents think not.

            <Text>Ingar
Largest town in Eibar province, near the confluence of the [Bloo] and the [Bighotti]

Role in Story
One of the oldest towns. Close to the eastern border and the Krbsh Sea. Get a taste of travelers from afar.

Related Characters
A number of characters who play a role in the Saskan Lands but come from outside of it arrive via Ingar. May also be a place where defectors, escapees go to — who are considering emigration. 

Season
Typically humid. 

Unique Features
Something of a safe haven for inbound and outbound refugees. Since it is so foundational to Eeberian culture and language, it is difficult for fundamentalist Sun worship to get a foothold. Think of its relation to mainstream (Besquohuk) Heliocastronism as something like that of Iran (prior to the mullah regime) and/or maybe Turkey to the Sunni-Arab-Islamic world — yes, we are believers, but with our own rich history and traditions thank you very much.  

Description

While not one of the largest towns, it has a lot of traffic, with three roads in and out and close to two major bends in the river. Also close to the border with Lewshanana. It is one of the few towns that has “suburbs” around it for some distance, rather than just rural villages and farms. 
Sights
The Great Holly Temple, featuring a gigantic drooping holly tree at its center, is an ancient elaborate structure that has been built up and around the tree for generations.  It is officially a Helioptic place of worship but the upper floors were appropriated by the “High Council of the Eiber Folk” many years ago.  

This is ostensibly a kind of low-key language academy, devoted more to collecting information about Eiber accents, dialects and so on than trying to enforce a “proper” Eibar. In reality, and obvious on the uppermost floors, it is more like a combination trading company / bank / insurance company, sponsoring multiple types of sea-faring and other expeditions on behalf of its board.  

The “High Council” plays an important role in financing (loans, credits, partnerships) throughout the northern and eastern provinces. It works with Kahila enterprises to some extent, but is very wary of basimi influences.  

Active/devout Heliocastronic membership is low as compared to other Helioptic centers. The Day Watch is active and visible, but mainly deals with ordinary law/order concerns.  The Night Watch is seldom heard from, dealing mainly with more obscure espionage concerns.  

The Gleaming is not observed in Ingar.  Instead, there is an annual voluntary public Confession in which Sun worshippers process to the River while chanting mournfully and punching each other in the arm. At the river they perform a ritual bathing, to wash away any “moonful and starry excrescence” that has accumulated during the past year. 

There is an Astrologers Laboratory in Ingar, as well as a variety of small, but well-attended Kahila and Barbasol temples and meeting-houses scattered throughout the town and its surroundings. There is even a “First Arrivers” community which seeks to build up good relations between Eibar and Oubar provinces.
Sounds
A busy, active place. Lots of coming and going. Lots of commerce.

            <Text>Scatterling
A village in the province of Barboskanti

Role in Story
A place where [“the Green”], a philosophical school, has a center and where various incarnations of the  &quot;Mages Guild” gathersfrom time to time.

Related Characters
Main (open) guilds with an important presence in the village are Tailors and Herbalists. 

Season


Unique Features
Produces unique clothing known for its style and durability. 
The Herbalists of Scatterling are known for having cures that actually work against deadly diseases and infections. Continuing the theme of the façades of the place, these Herbalists front for one of the few active medical clinics, including surgeries, in the region.  

Description
Well-removed from Helioptic control, but with several layers of obfuscation and misdirection in its organization. The Mages who gather here are deeply influenced by and infiltrated by the Green.  A Helioptic Scholar is in residence as well.  Mixed and formed sentients are respected, well-treated.  It is a place famous for its hospitality.   

Sights
Boasts two “ancient artifacts” of interest especially to Eelaners and other old-time-religion types:  a manual typewriter and a slot machine.

            <Text>Qurol
In the Borda Woods, on the Ring, on the River [Bloo]

Role in Story
One of the most “open” and beautiful and popular of the Helioptic Towns. 

Related Characters
The High Priest of the Sunny Center has hands quite busy dealing with all the travellers, commercial trade, immigrants from the west.  Although very much officially a Helioptic-dominated town, dedication to Law, to the Watch, is less about policing belief and more about bringing in the goods. For this reason, the Days of Gleaming in Qurol are much more ceremonial and much less physical than in some other towns.

Season
Quite a beautiful place, with its views of the river and the ring, hills to the north and west, the forest of the Borda Woods to the south and the rich farmlands and villages along the River to the east. 

Unique Features
Has a rich collection of bard songs, due in part to its proximity to Eelan.

Description
Has a large contingent of Helioptic Guards and Volunteers. Though they remain fairly quiet and out of sight, the town is in fact very well fortified. In Helioptic terms, it is considered the “Lion’s Gate” protecting the north-western corner of the Heliopticon. 
Lots of trading, bartering, negotiating goes on here as various Heliop factions and guilds, a number of independents and Rider-affiliated groups, as well as [Finders] and others seek to buy, steal, borrow, exchange, expropriate, learn from/inform on each other.  
Sights
Five working streetlights are maintained for the amusement of traditionalist visitors.  There are several small [“Jossist”] temples in Qurol.
The [“Finders Guild”] has a significant presence in the Town, with many sorts of oddball goods and services on offer. 
 A cash/ATM machine — another shrine-like destination — is actually a spy station/drop site for a secret, underground enclave of Createds from the Krunk. Many Jaxen emerge from and are re-cycled through Qurol.  It is easy to recruit servants and “redshirts” in Qurol as a result.  During the epic events of the book, there will be “trouble in river city” because of this — masked as something like a “servants uprising”.  
Sounds
Due to its role as a transit and exchange hub, quite a few languages and dialects are heard here.
As one of the older towns — it predates the expansion of authority by the Heliocastron known as the Reckoning — Qurol has a rich bard song tradition that encompasses much more than tunes and lyrics favored by the Sun-worshipers. Performance is common in inns and public spaces.

            <Title>Borded in Salofess and Mabalbesq</Title>
            <Text>Borded
On the Ring, on the main Tributary of the Northern River

Borded is the largest and in many ways the most important town in Saskantinon.  It is the most powerful enclave within the region that is not under the control of the Heliocastron and it the central town for four northeastern districts, including the Riders Realms of Mabalbesq, Bordaloon and Salofess. With its strong walls, well-cared-for streets and buildings, many of which are made of enormous stones, its beautiful gardens and the large well-tended free-holder fields which surround it, the town of Borded, the Riders Town, is a wonder and a delight to behold.  

The Riders Council provides for the preservation of order in Borded.  As the home base of a militarized guild which specializes in import-export trade and arms manufacturing, Borded is both well-provisioned and well-fortified.  


Sitting astride the Ring to the northeast, Borded is Saskantinon's great jewel along the River Bloobar, which flows by just to the south of the town.   In times of trouble, sentient folk from all the surrounding regions flock to the protection of its massive walls. Its two towering gates on the Ring Road make it impossible to proceed along the Ring without passing through Borded. A smallernorthern gate opens to the Mabal Trail, leading north to the border town of Beet.  

Dominating the Ring Road in this way forces many foreign travelers to go through Borded on their way to the Helioptic capital or to pretty much anywhere else in Saskantinon.


One might usefully think of the sub-areas , usually referred to as provinces [we’ll find more words…] of Saskantinon as something like counties or departments or districts.  None of them have official standing as far as the Helioptic Union is concerned, but these sub-regional designations are very commonly-used cultural, historical, demographic and geographical terms and many residents of the Saskan Lands refer to these sub-regions in a fundamental way.  The districts are sometimes grouped as either Inside or Outside, depending on whether they sit inside or outside of the Great Ring Road.  

Borded is the focal point for four of the Eibar-speaking northeastern regions, encompassing two “Outside” provinces – Mabalbesq and Bordaloon – and one “Inside”: Salofess.  The Riders Council also has a strong but considerable less direct influence on the region of Eelan, the south of Bordaloon.


In the steeply ascending mountains to the west of Borded, following the River Bloobar up into the “Forbidden Hills” of the Krunkinotto, is the heavily guarded Outer Province of Mabalbesq, patrolled almost exclusively by the Riders. The Mabalbesq is the only human-inhabited region of Saskantinon that is, for all intents and purposes (though not officially) off-limits to Heliocastronic agencies.  It is the Rider hinterland.   


A High Priest of the Heliocastronic Office is assigned to the Town of Borded.  He resides in a fine temple and receives respectful treatment as the leader of a popular religion and chair of an important guild alliance. But the Helioptic Union does not control Borded.  Here the Sun's Watchers are not even permitted to build a barracks.  The prestige, wealth and military potency of the town resides entirely with the Riders Council, who exercise their (mostly) unquestioned authority through a democratic charade known as the Free Hostelries Cooperative Council. 

This Riders-led guild alliance includes the Vintners, Brewers and Bakers Guilds as well as the Free Innkeepers and a few other less well-established guilds.  It also has significant ties to mining interests and weapons manufacturing.

Multiple names

Role in Story

Military outpost run by the Riders Guild, with the veneer of being run by the Heliopticon.  A Helioptic Scholar officially presides over the camp and there are barracks for the Helioptic Volunteers there.  But in Camp Borda the local offices are entirely manned by the Riders Guild “on behalf of” the Heliocastronic Center.

   Despite its relatively mundane appearance as a well-kept military enclosure, the camp contains some interesting and sophisticated resources. As with Borded, though less obviously so, it is very difficult for strangers to approach the camp  undetected.  Unlike Borded, entry into the camp is not permitted without invitation.  The camp is a military outpost that also provides certain types of specialized training, mainly for Riders but also for Helioptic Volunteers and others willing to pay for the privilege of having access to Rider training, technology and techniques.

            <Text>Beet
A town in Mabalbesq, on the border with Wesshewen and Norgyte

Role in Story

The town of Beet is located northeast of Borded on the border with the Wesshewen plains, basically in the middle of frikking nowhere.  Standing in the middle of the northern plains, right on the Weshewn border, this remote place’s mayoralty is held by a High Priest appointed by the Heliocastronic center to officiate its affairs, but “advised” by a permanent office of the Riders Guild, referred to as the Riders’ “Cadenza”.  

The northern part of the walled town — where the prison is located — is actually located across the border, according to official records. This bit of legality means that, to the extent there is any actual “law” in Saskan Lands, it does not apply to North Beet.

These two officials manage the town together from a joint office known as The Wardening, located next to the prison in North Beet.

Beet is not a place that many folk ever choose to visit.  Though there are regular inhabitants of the town who don’t work at the prison, and there is a sizable Holding to the south of Beet where both freeholders and indebted sentients work the land, it is effectively a penal colony jointly managed by the Riders Guild and the Heliops.  

People and animals from the various provinces, as well as foreign travelers who have been found guilty of crimes significant enough to be sent away, or who are thought to be serious security risks, are brought here to work the fields — mostly in the northern holdings, usually in chains. They also get rented out to southern landholders, where work conditions are not as bad and there are priosner-sympathizers among the rural population.   

Even more stringent types of restraints are hidden away behind the unassuming-looking walls of Beet.  Produce from The Beet flows mainly into the Helioptic provinces.  But since much of its output is routed through Borded, the Riders get their cut as well. 

Given its relatively large shaped-human and talking-animal population, plus the fact that it serves as a concentration point for malcontents, and despite the efforts of the Wardening, Beet is a node for communications within and between various subversive, criminal or otherwise shady and secret organizations.  

It is rumored that the Kilikon Mina, an extremely dangerous bitama outfit that is sometimes thought to be associated with the Heliocastron, have their headquarters here.  It seems unlikely, given that this is pretty much Rider territory, but who knows...

            <Text>Hadika
Northeastern corner of Norgyte, northernmost tip of Salotriza, on the border with “The Shadow Lands”

Role in Story


Related Characters


Season


Unique Features


Description

The town of Hadakik (or Hadika, depending on your dialect) sits on the border with Wesshewen, near the western foothills of the Lewshan Mountains, in what is sometimes called “The Shadow Lands”.  Its holdings are all on its southern side of the town. There is no opening in the town's walls towards the north or the east. 

The town’s only gate, to south, sits on the Mixry Road, which is the border between Norgyte and Salotriza.  

Hadakik is very much a military town and part of the martial traditions and lore of both Norgyte and Salotriza, though in the popular imagination it is probably more closely associated with the Songs of Service and the Obligation of a Volunteer, a song cycle and a long solo vocal piece, respectively, honoring the Volunteers.  

It has a long history as a front-line defense against raiders from the north and “monsters” from the east.  The Chief of the Watch is the undisputed and leading Helioptic official here.  With its large Day Watch and two permanent barracks for Volunteers as well, there is a disciplined military aspect to most activities in the town.  The Riders Guild also has a significant military presence her, where they collaborate closely with the Helioptic militias. 

The dominant guild alliance in Hadadik is The Candle-makers Craft Hall, commonly referred to in the militant anthems that tend to make up the the jaunty Bardsongs of the Northern Gate as “The Three Lights”.  Including the Armorers and the Cobblers, along with the Carpenters-Candle-makers guilds, the Hadadik Craft Hall is an effective military supply organization. It produces high-end, heavy-duty metal armor such as chain- and ring-mail, all types of leathery and bony things, along with exquisite short swords and knives.  The continuous demand from both the Heliops and the Riders for military equipment guarantees that such guild business thrive here. 

Hadakik is not a closed town.  The  trade carried on by the Hadakik Candle-makers Craft Hall is conducted with partners from all around the Ring. Hadakik hosts one of the best-known and best-supplied arms bazaars in the Saskan Lands.

Love. Healing.
Related Characters
 

Seasons
In the region around the upper [Barbo], idyllic rolling waters, hillsides full of plants, flowers, herbs. Not eternal spring, but something like that year-round.  
In the region around the upper Blue, the highest peaks in the Saskan Lands.  The snowiest region.
Unique Features
The only province that lies in part outside of the more-or-less recognized borders of Saskantinon (?). More like — the most remote, least centrally-controlled region.  Not the only mountainous/hilly regions (see: Eelan, Bordaloon and Salofess), but the most mountainous and remote.
A good number of fairly well-maintained roads/paths run through the region. 
Description
The name “weir” may echo Anne McCaffrey’s fictional world of Pern, which used “weyr”. That implies that “dragons” now live or once lived here.  In my world, this could serve as an allusion to the long-lost knowledge of / desire for flight. 
A “weir” is a small man-made dam, always with a flow of some kind, often with a fish ladder. Every human culture builds them. The western Saskan Lands host many creeks, rivers, riverlets and so on and a rich constructed eco-system for irrigation and fishing. 
The “wind lords” (or..) of “New Weyr” (or.. “High Weir”, or…) and the region around the town will be a key into this part of the story. Working through how to approach this in a subtle, interesting way. It is the only town located on a mountain. And like New Harvest (ugh), it conceals some secrets.  Caves/underground installations with allusions to both flying animals and flying machines.   I have a Blender sketch of a crazy kind of tower that could be the castle or observatory or both of the “wind lords”.
Sights
Main towns are New Weyr and New Harvest.  New Harvest sits above an underground town called Freedom. (yuck)

Sounds
Many small waterfalls, rapids. Lots of non-sentient wildlife, though birds and flying insects are unknown, or at least very rare. Many caves and some cenotes.

Sub-Regions
Although most of Weirland is protected by the [Wind Lords] of High Weir, this is not an officially-declared border. The boundaries between their domain on the one hand, and Eelan, Selessaluga, [Bordaloon] and the Oaknaught Lands on the other, are fluid and flexible. The riders of High Weir are sometimes called the Raithmadoro, which alludes to their ancient role in combating the machinic raiders from the north. The area is sometimes referred to as the Raith Lands in recognition of the threat posed by the little-understood Jaxen assaults. 

Salessalaga, the area around Harvest in the southern section of Weirland, is autonomous culturally from the rest of Weirland. It is distinctly feminist, with the women of Harvest having a large influence on the surrounding countryside. Known for being full of “magic”, due partly to its border with Aranzen and partly to its openness to both sentients with “powers” and to mixed sints of all types.

These are country/hill people, hard working miners, not easily impressed, fond of their folkways.

Duty. Tradition
Related Characters


Season


Unique Features
Only one well-kept road through the region, it directly connects Eelan to Bordakal in the Borda Woods and through a much more circuitous route to Mabhakol in Bordaloon. A smaller, more difficult road connects Eelan to Qurol, just inside the Ring and on the Northern River.  These are mainly commercial connections. Eelaners seldom leave the region.

Description
The region is loosely allied to the Riders, but does business with the Heliops too.  The folk-religion involves a kind of worship of “ancient artifacts”, but without any hidden meaning, just a kind of ecstatic belief in redemption-from-toil and talismans against re-emergence of catastrophe. Americans might read it as a kind of Baptist faith, de-centralized, congregational, anti-hierarchical, but has some aspects of saint/guru practice also in the manner of Sufis, Sikhs and some Hindus.

Sights
Eelan is the main town in the province of Eelan. Several large mining operations in the region.  Many mining roads throughout the region.

Sounds
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho.  Work, work, work. The region will remind some readers of a kingdom of the dwarves.
Smelting, hammering, carts rolling. Lots of singing to go with it.

“The Land of Men” in a way.  Part of the loyal Rider countryside. Prosperous.  Refines and manufactures goods. Supplies both Borded and Qurol. But also exposed to the “new thinking” of the Weyrlands. As the epic unfolds, the Rider faction who break away are centered in Bordaloon.

Ethics. Sacrifice. 
Related Characters
Main towns are:

 Mabhakol. Very high tower, well-fortified. Lots of manufacturing of all types. Built next to an active and deep mine. Overlooks the Northern River just before it flows under the Ring. 

Borded, the great Rider capital, sits on the Ring just on the other side of the River, both of which make up borders to this province. While formally it sits astride 2 other provinces, Borded is the undoubted metropolitan capital of Bordaloon.
Season
I think of Bordaloon as often a bit dark and gloomy in its mid-section, more like Eelan and the Weyrlands to the south, and a kind of arid plain to the north, but increasingly well-irrigated the closer one gets to the river. 

Unique Features
A very large peak defines its western border with the Krunkinotto range.
A large military encampment just over the border with Mabalbesq, north of the river. 
Description
In many ways the Rider’s “homeland”.  Many ring riders and others who work directly for the council in Borded hail from this region.

Unique Features
The prison town of Beet is located in its northeastern-most corner.  
A large fortified encampment (“Camp Borda”, “Bo’Mabal”) is located in the province, guarding the Saskan Lands from Krunki incursions.  


Description
The location of many historic battles. Travellers in the region will see numerous commemorations  to the fallen. 
Prison-gang work units are common in the northern part of the province.  

Sights
Rolling, grassy plains. Both farming and grazing. 
Fences and hedges are deeply frowned-upon in this region. There is a popular/traditional sentiment of reverence for the big sky. Although the province is generally and correctly considered to be a Rider stronghold, there are many Helioptic influences as well. This has created a kind of kinder-gentler version of sun-worship that focuses on the sky as a whole, puts much less emphasis on fear of the night, stars. 
Sounds
Along with the more martial Riders’ Bardsongs, the region is also home to a rich tradition of song and music relating to “the Beet Farm”, including many kinds of bluesy laments as well as songs celebrating populist criminals and rebels, songs telling sad tales of endings and persecutions, and some with cryptic instructions on how to help escapees, how to avoid incarceration, and how to connect with rebel networks inside “the Big House”.

Unique Features


Description

Like Mabalbesq, Norgyte is mostly a wide-open plain of grassy plains.  Wind, rain, even tornados are not uncommon, though its reputation as a having a “harsh” climate is way overblown. 
Also like Mabal, Norgyte has been the site of numerous armed conflicts and has a reputation as the “bulwark against barbarism” — it is the martial center of the Helioptic Volunteers, in their traditions and songs, it represents the Heliops’ ability to keep the Saskan Lands safe and whole. 

Sights
By area, Norgyte is one of the largest provinces in the Saskan Lands.  Mostly very rural. Roads are not so good. 

The large border town of Hadika is located on the border between Norgyte and Saloriza to the east.  It is far and way the most metropolitan part of the province.  Like the province, Hadika is very much a military-oriented and Helioptic town. 

The small town of Mixry is located in the southeastern corner of the province, just north of the Ring.  Kind of an odd place, really, it consists largely of a huge ancient tower where many of its residents live and work. 

Sounds


Smell
Norgyte is the center for meat-production in the Helioptic Saskan Lands. As such, there are some fairly gross locations (slaughter-houses, meat-packaging facilities, meat-drying farms, etc.).

            <Text>Languages

Role in Story
Develop a rhythm, a cadence, a set of sounds that helps to give a feeling to the place. In developing place-names, a kind of glossary of common endings that helps to identify a region and its population.

As I get more depth, reflect this in the types of names of organizations, of songs/ballads/legends as well. 

Language reflects and even creates philosophy and art. Work on specific words, concepts that might be uniquely reflective of the sense of a place, or of an aspect of the story that is rooted in a place, or of a feeling I am trying to evoke.  

Not looking to go “full Tolkien” but nor do I want to just have sort of standard D&amp;D naming. I do want to play around with allusions to musical concepts.  I do want to be a bit silly in this regard (“Ringtoons”, “The Box of Jook”, etc.) since part of my fantasy is that the game — and the stories — will have a musical “resonance”.   

The overall conceit I am working with is that the entire world is, in fact, the creation of a group of Agents who were tasked with stitching this world back together after significant social and ecological catastrophes nearly destroyed it.  And that this is in fact just one of many worlds where they have had to do so, and they are not “gods” in any meaningful sense, just somewhat-advanced sentients tasked with “urban renewal”, if you like, who are just doing the best they can.  Not quite as silly as “Hitchhiker’s Guide”, but more in that vein than, say, “Game of Thrones”. 

In some way, I’d like for language - and playing with language - to be an active part of the story-telling and a dynamic aspect of the game play. This will need to develop of course. I don’t want to “stop the machine” to work it all out ahead of time.  But I am interesting in introducing algorithms, rules, hints/suggestions, a poetics that help to build up the language and dialects. 

Related Points
Am not intending to develop character sets or full-blown phonologies at this point, though that might be fun and could be quite interesting.  I did have some code at one point that did a little bit of this and might come back to that.  

For starting out, the rule is to keep it as simple as possible.  Write about the languages and dialects. Make mastery of them a useful skill like any other for a character to have.  But pay more attention to providing entertaining and descriptive names, concepts, etc. in English than trying to come up with neologisms at every turn.
Description

The major languages of the Saskan region — Eeber, Eebarq, Oober, and Oobarq — are in the Bar (Ber?) family of languages.  Minor members of the Bar language family are Aber, Khaliber, Juuker, Salober and Ellaber.  (All of these names are subject to change.  Try playing with -er instead of -ar. Oober? Ohber? Ober? Eeber? :-) )


Eebar.  Eebar is the language spoken by most humans and human-appearing residents of Saskantinon, as well as by most other residents, of whatever genetic mix, who live north of the River Barbo and east of Kahilabarbakal, and with the exception of Kahilbek and Beavertoon, where Eeber is common but Oober is more pervasive.  It is the most widely-spoken language in Saskantinon.

It is the native language of the northern and western regions. As the official language of the Heliocanoptic scribes it is the language of power in the region.  While it is not the first language of Beavertoon, many of the residents of that province, especially those involved in jurisprudence, are experts at it and may speak (and write) it even better than, say, a rural farmer from Rontona or a rancher from Jivákala. 

The standard accent of Eeber (Eiber?) is that of the province of Eebar (Eibar). This is mildly ironic.  Eibar was one of the earliest settlements of Ber-speaking humans in the region. Their pronunciation and idioms became the norm.  But as the centuries passed, Eibar itself became considerably more diverse, absorbing immigrants from Wesshewen, Lewshanana, Krbshanana and places even further away. These days, it is not unusual to hear all kinds of Eeber accents in Eibar itself, including Eebark. 

The other Eeber-speaking areas of Saskantinon have regional accents, in most cases minor variations in sounds and a few idiomatic words. The only ones that might come close to being considered full-fledged dialects are spoken in some of the more remote hills and valleys of Eelan, the Weyrlands and Bordaloon.


Eebark.  In the easternmost areas of the Saskan Lands north of the Barbo, in the provinces of Blurbaroon, Kahilabarbakal, Mobalbesq, and Beavertoon, but not so much in Eibar Province, it is more common to encounter shaped and mixed humans, which is to say sentients who are visibly genetic hybrids of humans with other species, than in other Eeber-speaking provinces. 

Within these areas, players with a more distinctively non-human-animal appearance, especially if they wish to emphasize their distinction, tend to favor the Eebarq dialect. Though Eebarq is mutually intelligible with Eeber it includes a number of phonemes rooted in other-than-human modes of utterance. Eebarq also has a welter of alternative phrasings and words, and some grammatical constructions, that would be considered “slang” or “incorrect” in “proper Eebar”.

Oober.  South of the River Barbo, Oobar rather than Eebar is the universal language.  Oobar and Eebar are closely-related members of the same language family. While they are mutually-intelligible to some extent, Oobar and Eebar are distinct languages.  The distance between them would be roughly equivalent to that between Spanish (Castillian) and Catalan in our world. 

Native Oobar speakers who need to interact with Heliocastronic officers or with human guilders who have trouble understanding Oobar are well-served by learning to communicate using Eebar.  It is not uncommon for Oobar-speakers to have some command of Eebar, especially if they travel much or do business with humans, as having this facility helps to smooth over and avoid difficulties interacting with humans and especially with Heliops.  It is rarer for a human, especially for a Helioptic true believer, to speak Oobar.  But it is not unheard-of, especially for Heliocastronic authorities or emissaries posted to Kahila lands or other non-Helioptic-majority provinces.

Just as Eebar province is the original home of “properly spoken” Eebar, so Oobar (Oubar) province is the birthplace of “correctly spoken” Oobar. It is believed by some sects of “First Arrivals”, as they call themselves, that the earliest mix of human and non-human DNA emerged from within the vast Salt Marshes near the Lake of Oo. And yes, it is sung that in centuries past, before the beaverfolk built the Wye Canal and flooded the plains of Oo to create Lake Oo, these many square klicks of mushy, salty marshland were called the The Oozes. Whether it is truly as the First Arrivers say or not, the Oobar language certainly appears to have emerged from this area and then spread across the southern Saskan Lands. It is still the main language used in Oobar province. To this day the residents of the town of Barqton pride themselves for being the hosts of the Oobar Language Academy and resist any attempts by Beavertooners to claim intellectual ownership over the langauge, even though most would agree that, as in so many other academic areas, the best Oober language schools are probably in Beaverton.

The Oobar language plays an important role in the liturgy and legends of the Barboskanti region and is closely identified with Barbo-centric belief and faith systems more generally.  A type of liturgical Oobar developed in eastern Barboskanti, where it is preserved, developed and taught especially within the cultural and religious meetings centered in the town of Barbol. 

Beavertoon natives are taught both proper Oobar and proper Eebar along with their own mildly distinctive Beavertoon-inflected dialect of Oobar.


Oobarq.  Further to south, in much of the unruly Uitibarbo area and in some of the northernmost areas of Grummik-speaking Krbshanana near the province of Oubar, a more growlish dialect of Oobar is spoken — known as Oobarq.  While some human-appearing-humans learn Eebark out of sympathy for their shaped and mixed colleagues and friends, or just in order to be clearly understood in certain environments, the Oobark dialect is in regular use almost exclusively by sentients with obvious and visibly non-human forms.  It is especially common for those players with “animalistic” features — as opposed to more “unnatural” non-human features, shapings or modifications. 

Along with its additional complexities of vocabulary, Oobark’s selection of animal-centric phonemes can be more difficult for humans to master as compared to than those used in Eebark.  

Furthermore, the offices of the Heliocastronic Watches, especially the Night Watch, consider the use of Oobark little short of insurrectionist.  A human speaking it inside the Ring in Helioptic provinces would certainly fall under suspicion, and could easily fall subject to hold in most Heliop-controlled towns and neighborhoods.  Being heard speaking it after sundown would most certainly get a player into hot water, possibly even marked for renewal in the next Gleaming. Even if not being actively sanctioned by the local Watch, a human-appearing sentient speaking Oobark even during the day is likely to fall under suspicion of being a pseudo-animal by residents of those regions.

Whilst spoken most commonly in the far to the south , below the Ring, as they say, it is not at all unusual to hear Oobark spoken anywhere south of the Barbo and even to a degree in the eastern sea-faring regions of Mobalbesq and Blubaroon.  In Kahilabek and Kahilabarbakal, the use of Oobark is not common. But neither does it being the kind of opprobrium as it does is in other Eebar-speaking areas.  Along with the more tolerant views of the Kahila folk, there its use tends to have a distinctly political overtones as well, but in an entirely different context.  Given the proximity of the two Kahila regions to the centers of Heliocastronic authority, speaking Oobarq  in the Kahila lands tends to be a way of demonstrating, particularly amongst the youth, an “up yours” attitude towards the Helioptic offices and watches.  It is often admired by peers as a “smart” or “hip” or “cool” thing to do amongst youngsters trying to make a reputations for themselves amongst the basimi and bitami outfits that make these putatively “rebellious” regions their base of operations.  It is not always considered so “smart” by basimi elders in those regions, who generally prefer to keep a low profile.

For the same reason, the use of Oobark is popular amongst the more extremist of the self-styled animal-supremacists and animal-liberationists, even amongst those for whom it is not their native tongue, though this tends to be the case in more rural areas far from oversight from the Watch or within earshot of Sunny border guards.


Doribah.   Eaiya is a language family that uses pitch and tone as the primary mechanism for constructing words and concepts, with phonemes playing a secondary role. As such, the basic set of Eaiya languages are very different from the Ber family of tongues. To players hearing an Eaiya language for the first time, it may sound more like what we might think of as a kind of jazz singing than a spoken language.   

This type of language is common in the western high mountainous region known to Bar-speakers as the Krunkinotto, among those beings who are said to have emerged from pre-catastrophic times after long hibernation underground.  

Ahber is a minor member of the Bar family spoken only in a few valleys of the Weyrlands beyond the borders of Sasakantinon, while Dorimea is an Eaiyan language common in the southern Krunkinotto, especially amongst Jaxen who have emerged amongst the Aranzen. A syncretic mix of Dorimea and Ahbar, originally a kind of pidgin, developed into a language of its own that does not fit neatly into either language family: a language called Doribah. It is one of several languages spoken by the Aranzen people, who live in the sparsely populated hilly country to the southwest of Saskantinon, near the Weyrlands.   

It is not unusual to encounter travelers and traders from Aranzen ain the western districts of Saskantinon.  There is regular cultural and economic exchange between Aranzen and the Saskan provinces of The Weyrlands. Aranzenners speaking/singing Doribah pop up regularly in the Barboskanti town of Barbol, which sits astride both the Ring and the Barbo not far from the border with Aranzen.  They can also be heard in the Uitibarbo port of Terpinol, which looks out for Saskan interests on the Aran Sea.  

Though travelers from Aranzen seldom travel inside the Ring — at least not openly — bards in both the Eeber and Oober traditions incorporate some elements of Doribah into their songs, both for musical effect and in order to encode messages that might be difficult for listeners to detect if they are not in-the-know regarding Doribahn tonal syntax. 


Growlsh.  Growlsh is a member of the Grumsh language family.  It spoken in the Krbshanana Peninsula, within the Krbsh Sea itself and in parts of the Forg and southern Lewshanana. Saying that something is growlish implies that it has a strong non-human aspect to it.  Saying that it is barqish is a much milder statement; it simply means that the speaker has an intentionally animalistic or even just an“exotic” accent.


Sounds
Use the Saskan Schema Glossary feature to work out more detailed elements of the languages, including sounds. Audacity and GarageBand are both good vocal DAWs. Try to collect / produce actual sounds and not only the phonetic equivalents.

            <Title>Story Arcs</Title>
            <Text>Here is a summary of Vonnegut’s lecture on story arcs. I want to play with these in order to help bring some structure to writing the story about Saskantinon.

Some basic advice on story-telling:
Tell a joke
Know your goal
Tell a truth
Make me care — emotionally, aesthetically, intellectually

Story arcs are emotional arcs. The y-axis typically describes ill-fortune (fall) and good-fortune (rise). The x-axis is time, from begin to end of the story.

Complex and popular stories may combine the 6 basic types of narratives sequentially. For example: Harry Potter stories.  But each coherent part of the overall epic is likely to follow one of the six basic patterns.

The most popular patterns are “Man in a hole” and “Cinderella”.  Cinderella is the most popular story arc in many traditions, especially western. Examples include:  creation myths and Christian redemption tales. See image.


1. Rags to Riches.  Rise. Steady, staggered or precipitous rise from ill- to good-fortune.
2. Riches to Rags.  Fall. Steady, staggered or precipitous fall from good- to ill-fortune. 
3. Man in a Hole.  Fall, then rise.
4. Icarus. Rise, then fall. 
5. Cinderella.  Rise, fall, then rise.
6. Oedipus. Fall, rise, then fall.  

——

For Act One, I am thinking an overall Oedipus (or Daedulus) trajectory is what I am after. 

I want to introduce a number of the settings and characters — 

Multiple small falls and close-ups… Barfalot/the Mages &amp; Bards; the bazaar in Rikiki/the Basimi guilds/Kahilabarbakal/Kahila folks/ALF types; the Riders Guild/Borded/Jess and Jenn; the languages and writings/how sents can get sent up; and a bigger fall, but not a Really Big Fall:  the darker side of Helioptic justice and duty/Beet, Mizry, the gleaming — which also lets us know about the very real threats from Wesshewen, Krunkinotto and Lewshenana; 

Rise: the joy and wonder of the two rivers; the musical interplay between “Sun worship” and “Moons worship”, seen via travelers on the Ring and the rivers; getting to know more of the towns, with hints about others that are farther away from the Ring; a first glimpse at the port towns on the Krbsh Sea; the whole deal with the beavers of Beavertoon; the freedom of New Harvest — and the mysteries of Aranzen and other Southern realms;   

Fall: end by looking out from Besquohuk and Jook; the day of gleaming, the passion of Jess and Jenn; rumors from the East


For Act Two, an overall Man in a Hole trajectory, with a Cinderella start.

Rise: The Kahila/Basimi rescue (of Jess, Jenn, others) from the gleaming. They are “born again”. 

Rise: Barfalot and crew pursue technology and alliances that will help to counteract the influence of the Heliops without weakening the humans (Riders, Heliops) so much that they will be open to attack from the North or the South. 

Falling/Rising: They encounter numerous difficulties, some losses. It starts to look like all is lost. We explore the death drive in some detail.  Then we encounter the Windward Angels / Wind Lords (not sure what I want to call them) &amp; the underground caverns, where new technology and new ideas are introduced. We get the first glimpse of what the Enclosure really consists of. 

Rise/Falling/Rising: A sea voyage takes place and we start to learn more about the rest of the world, about other evolved sentients, and get the first hints about the Agency.  This prolongs the suspense (I hope) in the sense that it repeats the fall/rise theme. The ship may be lost, but it’s not. The Sea may be full of monsters, but it’s not; it is the home of some important friends — taking us all the way back to the first scene with those onto-barmen.  We may fall off the edge of the world, or we may pass into a realm of horror/radiation, etc.. but we don’t. 

Rise: The new technology is both philosophical — not external revolution but internal evolution, not expanded consumption but expanded sharing — and technological/“magical”: flight. We meet a type of creature that has been missing throughout the story so far:  birds.  (Note to self: introduce an island or two of birds somewhere out in the Krbsh Sea).  And we meet the mutants at New Weyr who have some similar abilities — also perhaps levitation (introducing a magical element that can’t be easily explained) — are they holographs? Is it magnetism? Something else?  And in the underground — plans for gliders, kites, balloons, parachutes. 

Rise: We literally rise out of a hole at the end of Act Two as we see the first balloons rise and birds flying.

For Act Three, we finish with everybody’s favorite: Cinderella

Rise: The flotilla, on air and sea, makes its way towards the North East, while the basimi, the bards, the bivers and the herbalists lay the groundwork for introducing change. It all looks exciting when…

Fall, fall, fall: Trouble strikes from multiple directions. An uprising of the clones is coordinated with an attack from Krunkinotto. Barbarian gangs and nomads from the Weshewen plains take advantage to press an assault.  The outbreak of “monsters” in Lesshewan causes trouble in the Northeast and a similar outbreak in the Forg makes waves for the seaborne. This causes political problems most of all — to be seen undermining the Riders and the Heliops at this point would not only be unpopular; it could embolden the enemies at the gate. The resistance is slowed down, put on hold in some areas, and it is betrayed.   All this happens quickly, like an adventure movie that opens up with epic car chases and gun fights.

Trouble: Resistance is redirected to assist in the “national defense”.  The octo-led sea forces and their bird-allies redirect to drive the monsters back to the Forg. With the Riders and Heliop Volunteers having to defend the northeast against invading hordes, the basimi and assorted “dark elf” (Kahila) and “ALF” forces go to the rescue of the towns of the Northeast. Meanwhile, far from the center of things, the Windlords are assisted by the Aranzen (who have some “magical” qualities of their own) in turning back a flanking attack from the Krunkinotto to the south. The conflict in the southern hills draws in the Miners of Eelan, who become aware of the considerable advances that have occurred due to Barfalot’s machinations. They defect to the “rebel” side. 

Trouble: Meanwhile, a “glass bead game” style showdown is taking place in Jook, as PQ’s trial draws near its conclusion, involving the eldest advisers to the Heliocastro and the most senior learned members of the Reformed Bivertoon Academy of Historical and Juridical Cacography.  We become aware that incognito Agents are in attendance too. They reveal themselves to some extent in order to influence the debate, by telling “parables” about worlds that could not be rehabilitated following their Catastrophical Eras. 

Rise, but oops still falling: The Rider and Heliop forces are victorious in the Northeast. Then in an astounding betrayal, orders go out to arrest and otherwise subdue the basimi-led forces. The Helioptic Volunteers start moving en masse East to take over the battle against the monsters.  The debate in Jook is interrupted by a team from Besquohuk who lie so fast, so loudly, with such felicity — introducing the “new theology of post-catastrophic optimism” — that the Jook elders are taken in by it. When they announce the need for a “New Gleaming”, the Biveroon philosophers begin to despair, and consider leaving. Agents begin to draw up reports downgrading the whole place. 

Rising, but still trouble: Meanwhile, the clones have been defeated in the Southwest and the monsters have retreated to the Forg. The flotilla makes its way to the ports and prepares to defend the Kakila folk from the “New Gleaming” as reports begin to come in of the first massacres and so on.

Rising: As would be expected the Riders leadership refuses to participate in the “New Gleaming”, but does offer help in securing the Northeast. At this point they are confronted by the Miners of Eelan, who insist on a different approach and point out that a new three- (or more-) sided alliance not only makes the region more secure, but that there is no assurance the combined air and sea forces of the “rebels” could be defeated. Furthermore, they support PQ’s case and fear that even if the monsters are defeated, there will be an eco-collapse.

Rise: The Riders agree. Their reps go the Great Trial, along with Barfalot, and offer a new vision to the assembly. Riders go to the Northeast, disrupt attacks against the Kahila folk, and together the Riders, the (next generation of forward-thinking) Heliops and the assorted Kahila-folk and their allies drive back the monster hordes.

Rise: The sky-flotilla emerges. Balloons, kites, banners, gliders — and birds, bees and butterflies — are seen all over the Saskan Lands, to the astonishment and delight of all.    The agents rewrite their reports.

Coda (riches to rags, a standard monster-sci-fi ending…)

From the swamps of the Forg, a dragon-beast arises.

Deep in the underground bunkers of the Krunkinotto, a spy-Jax returns from Saskantinon, with diagrams and blueprints of flying machines.  These are shown to a system that is developing something like rocket fuel.



Cinematic concepts that may be useful

Read Blake Snyder’s “Save the Cat” and Syd Fields “The Foundations of Screenwriting”. 

These offer good tips. Need to be mindful of whether I am writing a novel or a movie screenplay. Maybe the former with an eye towards the latter?  At any rate, some good and useful tips include:

* Jungian archetypes matter.
  * I’ve acquired most of Jung’s works. Read them!
  * I’ve also ordered the fundamental books by Joseph Campbell. Read them!
  * I found a book on Lex’s shelf by Stephen Fry which is his re-telling of Greek myths. Read it! 

* Understand who the hero is and make sure they are active and emotionally engaged.
  * Sleepy, inactive heroes are boring.
  * “Special effects” heroes are boring.
  * Be able to describe the developmental arc of the hero and other main characters.

* Be able to describe the entire plot using 4 rows of 10 cards. This is the Board. Let’s get Hegelian.
  * Row 1 = ACT ONE (thesis)
  * Row 2 = The first part of ACT TWO (antithesis)
  * Row 3 = The second part of ACT TWO (more antithesis)
  * Row 4 = ACT THREE (synthesis)

* Make sure to:
  * Include excitement in the “first reel” = the first ten minutes.
  * Introduce most if not all main, important characters in ACT ONE
  * Introduce an interesting twist, often with a new character, in the second part of ACT TWO, 
    when action make be starting to lag a bit.
  * Start of ACT TWO with a big problem for the hero/protagonist.  It should be a big moment.
  * Introduce a new, even worse problem later in ACT TWO.
  * Master sub-text and exposition. What is left unsaid. What is implied. The subtle, wry comment.
    * These have much more impact than dry, rote exposition.
    * When describing place, setting and so on, use clues and canonical images, not one-dimensional photography.
  * Find and eliminate, smooth out “black holes” in the Board - a gap where nothing happens, or doesn’t fit the overall structure of the story. Look to insert “booster rockets” wherever things are getting dull.
  * Include some “callbacks” — a seemingly innocent, minor detail, usually in ACT ONE, that turns out to be an important plot element later on.  Can be lighthearted as well, like helping to explain a joke or catch-phrase.
  * The “log-line” and the “poster”. 
     * How do I describe the story in a brief statement?
     * What image captures its essence?
  * What is primal? Sex, survival, hunger, revenge. Without some good primal energy, unless you are producing for a European art house audience, it will be unlikely to sell.

Other Good Resources

* For thinking in terms of video game art and story telling:
Chris Solarski’s “Interactive Stories and Video Game Art” and “Drawing Basic and Video Game Art”

* Basic concepts of art, shape, shadow, light, drawing; classical forms:
  * Charles Bargue Drawing Course 
  * Visual Guide to Classical Art Theory
  * Light for Visual Artists
  * Everything by Andrew Loomis

* Design concepts, especially data and programming, but more generally too:
  * Everything by Edward Tufte
  * Everything by Christopher Alexander
  * Wilkinson, “The Grammar of Graphics”
  * Hamming, “The Art of Doing Science and Engineering”
  * Gregory, “Game Engine Architecture”
  * Shariat, “Tragic Design”
  * Spinellis, “Beautiful Architecture”

Neologisms

Fun to introduce a few in a scifi/fantasy story, but don’t want to go too overboard without good reason

Words, phrases, modifiers used in the story may include...
-  &quot;Bek&quot; and &quot;-bek&quot; and &quot;Trubek&quot; to indicate a &quot;fully human&quot; sentient.

Try to keep a distinction between the “common language” — the one I am writing the story in — and the various languages and dialects referred to in the story.

            <Text>Sketch out the various and competing senses of Law, and also associate them with geographic regions.  There should be consequences for actions (along with rewards). The Saskan Lands are “wild” in some ways, but not in all ways.  
Don’t want to go too wacky with this, as it may not bring joy to things, but something to consider…


List things one can be fined / arrested / punished for in the various towns, according to various authorities. This is especially important in Helioptic Towns.

Some basis for understanding, studying, modifying the Law should be in place.  I have some structure outlined for “Arguments” issued by the Helioptic Center, by scholars from Wye, and by advocates from Biveroon (who additionally have their own body of law). 

Along with these formal schools, show how a more “natural” understanding of Law abides in many of the southern communities, and how tradition/omerta and so on operate in the Kahila (and possibly other) areas. 

The Created have their own sense of Law, driven by blind algorithms, I guess. 

The Agency had directives, but they’ve been lost in the mists of space and time and agents are just doing their best to figure it out as they go…

The Weshewen is a wind-swept desert of lawlessness.

            <Title>Journalism</Title>
            <Text>Barqalot uses connections with Inn Keepers, Wind Lords, Kahrn/herbalists, Henqu, Iohane and others to create a “popular journal”, something never seen before.

The “Saskan Times” is an illustrated folio (8 pages), written mostly in Eeber with some articles in Oober. It is published weekly, sold in the towns mostly via Free Innkeepers. At 10 bits a copy, only the wealthy can afford it, but it is passed from hand to hand, each copy read many times and often read aloud as well. In some places, parts of it are reproduced as broad-sheet style paintings. 

It contains news of goings-on in the towns and in the country side, as well as lyrics to and/or reviews of new songs or modifications to classic bardsongs. 

Published in New Weyr with stories, news, drawings collected by Barqalot’s far-flung network and brought to the west by various means. Some gossip and innuendo is included, along with heroic depictions of characters in our story.  It provides a kind of story-within-the-story mechanism, and is a story-line in itself. 

Its reporting is not always entirely accurate.  “The Passion of Henqu” is a recurring series that became widely popular, which eventually contributes to the attempt to subject Henqu to the extremes of a Gleaming.

The journal also popularizes Birakay and promotes him in the role of Ark Pilot, which is blasphemy for Heliopters.

Don’t want to repeat / copy items found in Gamma World, though some “odes” would be appropriate. 
In some respects, open odes to Gamma World would be cool, and maybe a nice “hook” into a special audience that can be the trigger.
Don’t want to over-do, especially in the Saskan Lands. Leave more exotic stuff for the Lewshanana, the Forg, the Krbsh Sea, Krbshanana and the Komexicon.

Struggling to find the right balance of “mutants”, sentient animal-sints, and “powers”. Not really eager to create a “superpower” story. Though I would like it make for a good graphic novel.

I do want to have some “talking animal” characters — rabbits, turtles, octopuses, geckos, something like a dragon (maybe) — but want to avoid anything that has been done before (dogs, cats, bears, horses). OK, well rabbits in “Watership Down”, but I’d love to take THAT to the next level.


Part of the “twist” will be that some “normal” species (from the reader’s perspective) have been — or have been thought to be — extinct for a long time.  The revitalization of these species either due to recurrence of natural selection, isolation, or through the engineering of the Agency or other players — needs to cause as much emotional shock/excitement as introduction of creatures that don’t exist in the reader’s world at all.

The big “twist” I am working with is the complete lack of flying creatures, even bugs, in the Saskan Lands and nearby. 

Not all “beasts” are “evil”. 

Some of the beasts I’d like to work with include:

After birds are re-introduced...
- Carrion Vultures: basically the same as we have, but bigger and willing to eat larger finds
- Giant Ravens: likewise, but even bigger, even more sentient and not mixed


- Giant Wolves: very dangerous
- Ghost Wolves
- Tree Spirits
- “Land Sharks”: big snakes/worms that travel underground. Very dangerous
- Lizard Bush: an aggressive and poisonous plant
- Dragon Bugs: very large insects, aggressive, a bit like the bugs in Starship troopers (accidentally introduced by early Agents)
- Jackalopes: pathological rabbits
- Orange Scarfers: pathological rodents

            <Text>The region is relatively wealthy and prosperous, as compared to bordering regions like Weshewen, Lewshanana, Krbshanana, the Forg and even Aranzen.  


FARMING

A key reason why so many non-humans stay in Saskantinon despite its somewhat confusing and even harsh political environment is agriculture does well in the region. And this is due almost entirely to the fact that the Herbalists have learned to take the place of birds and bees and this knowledge is widespread throughout the Lands.

 Nearly all of the towns and villages in the area maintain farming operations at one level or another of technological advancement.  Many farmers are free-holders. In the south, the Herbalist Federation acts as a kind of farmers cooperative. Many others are more-or-less vassals who work to support the nearest town and its institutions.  While the technological level is fairly rudimentary in many areas, the land is fertile enough to support a variety of techniques. 

Domesticated non-sint livestock for milk and cloth (fur) materials is fairly common. Using livestock for food is less common and somewhat controversial, especially in certain areas.

Mammalian meat plays a considerably smaller role in Saskan life than it does in our world. Both pigs and cows have sint and mixed “cousins” who look very unkindly on eating their “relatives” and feel it  is a threat.  There are no avians of any type, hence no chickens, etc.  Most meat-eating is aimed at fish, reptiles and insects.   


LAND

Land ownership is seldom private and individual. Where it is not in the trust of a local organization or guild or tribe or clan, it is often held by a collective of some kind and treated as something like a common resource.  


HUNTING and FISHING

The also region also supports a lot of grazing and hunting, especially in the north.  

It supports both a pastoral and nomadic economies, though nomadic/travelling bands are less common than settled ones. 

Domesticated livestock is common in the human regions of the north, though it is also the source of ongoing disputes and even sometimes violent conflicts between animal-liberationists and human-supremacists.  

A variety of wild beasts who are not sentient – in the sense that they do not use tools, use a language intelligible to other species, create urban or village centers, or develop an oral or written literature – roam the plains and mountains, especially in the northern, eastern and southern regions outside of the Ring. 

Hunting expeditions, almost always – but not exclusively – organized by humans or human-appearing guilders, constantly work these areas.  They gather and hunt in the western mountains and rivers too, although there tends to be less available prey in those areas. 

Fishing is common in both rivers and seas, with occasional disruptions from water-resident sints.

Fishing and sea-going trades are very common in the East, especially. As with hunting, this type of work can be fraught with difficulties and conflict due to the large number of fully-sentient animals inhabiting the Delta of Lewshanana as well as the Krbshsea itself.  Typically, they themselves are consumers of seafood, so it can be a little confusing — more a matter of competition than an ethical question.


MINING

Mining operations are located mainly in the western mountains, as well as near the marshy Krbshsea shoreline of the southeastern Oobar-speaking region.  


MANUFACTURING

Most manufacturing is at a fantasy-world-medieval level, with a focus on small-scale handicraft. There are few large manufactories, though some do exist. 

Common types of goods include:
- Prepared foods, food ingredients
- Prepared and fermented beverages
- Weapons and Armor
- Clothing and fabrics
- Conveyances (wagons, boats, and so on)
- Tools and Hardware
- Rope and Sails
- Cut stone and wood
- Medicines and psycho-active substances
- Musical instruments
- Scrolls, parchments, books and writing materials
- Pigments and brushes
- Candles, Lamps and Reflective surfaces (mirrors)
- Utensils and Containers

SERVICES

With the exception of agricultural goods, the provisioning of goods and services is dominated by guild monopolies, though there are competing guilds and geographical variations. 

See notes below on Trade.

Key “service industries” are also coordinated through guilds, though some are very loose. These include:
- Scribes
- Innkeepers
- Brooders
- Herbalists
- Healers and Scanners
- Finders (detectives and thieves)
- Guards / Volunteers / Watchers, etc. (cops and army)
- Riders (protection)
- Bards and Actors
- Carpenters
- Miners
- Sailors
- Advocates
- Hunters
- Smiths (also called “Joeys”)
- as well as the illicit/occult/secret ones, like:
	- assassins
	- mages
	- bikkhus
	- 
- and wacky/esoteric ones, like:
	- temple-keepers
	- elders
	- zizooks (philosophers)
	- artists

 


	




ART and TECHNOLOGY




LAND-BASED TRADE

The Ring and its major conduits are the heart of trade, commerce within the Lands. The role of the Riders in protecting the roads makes them crucial to its success and explains why they are closely tied into various commercial Guilds. 

Major guilds manage what we would think of as “stores”.  Most towns host regular “fairs”, on various schedules, and support open-air bazaars for small dealers and individuals. 


RIVER-BASED TRADE

As important as movement of goods on the Ring roads is movement of goods on the rivers and their tributaries. Here the eastern communes in Eebar and Wye and Biver have a bigger influence, as they tend to have the best capacities for maintaining fleets on the rivers, as well as handling sea-borne imports and exports.


SEA-GOING TRADE

In the larger context, sea-going trade in the near-sea is dominated by humans from Saskan Lands and animals or mixed sentients from both Lewshanana and Krbshanana, with some from the Forg, the Komexecon and Aranzen. 

Except for Lewshanana, the regions which border the Heliopticon to the east and to the south have enormous coastlines.  In the case of Krbshanana, it also has a large sentient marine population living within the Krbshsea itself. 

While we learn about lands further afield (outside the Enclosure) they don’t play an important role in the economy of the Saskan Lands.





MONEY


Summary

The Saskan Lands, though divided into semi-cooperative, semi-competing regions, supports a great deal of trade both within and between the various regions.  There is a fairly complex industrial-manufacturing guild structure and associated political and even religious institutions who support these trade links for both social and economic reasons.  On top of that, there is fairly widespread “black market” in several senses… certain services and goods are prohibited or restricted in some or all areas, so there is an “underground” and at least somewhat “illegal” economy in those cases.

Most trade occurs through five main channels. The first three tend to use fiat currencies (see more on this below), while the last two mostly do not, although formal exchange rate may still apply to the latter in some abstract sense.

* “Retail”, in the sense of (a) buying goods direct from a “guildhall”, which in many cases operates like a permanent, often indoor, market, including weapons and armor sales, or (b) buying goods at a town or village market. In most towns and villages there is a near-daily open-air market for small-scale trade in food, clothing, household goods, decorative items and so on, or (c) buying goods at an Inn or Tavern, which often operate as fronts for underground markets. Retail-level “pop up” markets tend to spring up when ships arrive in port, or when they are preparing to depart, as well. The same applies to land-based caravans. The slow-moving Terrapin Caravans are almost like a mobile open-air market.

* “Wholesale”, in the sense of (a) buying supplies for militias, Inns, Brooder houses, farms, and so on in bulk, usually either from a guildhall or a large-scale supplier of agricultural products or meat, (b) large-scale exchange directly between larger enterprises, for example, an armorer/blacksmithy guild regularly buys coal, wood, and materials for making iron and steel from miners and other suppliers, (c) suppliers who have no retail-level customers — mostly mines, some farms and ships — sell/trade only in bulk.

* “Foreign”. There is not much trade with entities outside of Saskantinon, but there is some, particularly in the border regions with Aranzen.  But also with mostly non-human entities in the Krbsh Sea. This is often in markets for rare goods and is one way in which those who know about the constraints imposed by the Enclosure manage to get around them, at least in some small ways.

* “Barter”. Practiced at the local level, including to some extent in village and town markets, this is the direct exchange of good and services at the small-scale, local level. It is more common among communities with a higher percentage of non-human DNA. But it is prevalent, especially in rural areas, throughout the Lands.  Among some less urbanized groups, it may even take on, at times, a quasi-religious significance lacking the direct tit-for-tat bargaining of more mundane bartering. These exchanges might take on, for example, the form of a gifting ceremony at one extreme, or some form of “traditional tribute” at the other extreme. 

* “Injection” and “Removal”. This refers to actions, almost always occluded in some way, taken by Observers and other Agents of extra-terrestrial or trans-dimensional institutions to “inject” or “remove” goods or services into (or less often, from) the Saskan economy for one reason or another. These actions are seldom if ever obvious for what they are. Agents are generally careful to concoct an elaborate scheme before interfering in this manner with human and human-plus social evolution. An injection might, for example, be a newly-”found” herb that helps to prevent (vaccinate against) spread of a certain deadly virus, while a “removal” might be aimed at preventing development of technology (say, for example, advanced internal combustion based on highly-contained use of carbon fuels) that the Agency has deemed “too dangerous” for use in the Enclosure.


Capitalism, Socialism, Wages, Exchange-Value

The Saskan Lands are by no means a highly-evolved capitalist economy, though there are many enclaves of abstracted exchange value, use of wages and so on, as well as prototypical and emerging capitalist situations.  Profit does motivate many players, but there is little sense in any of the predominant cultures of “getting rich” that is not tightly inter-related with guild or other institutional privilege and authority. Neither is it a highly-evolved socialist economy, though there are many aspects of the economy that focus on social solidarity and social needs as a primary motivation.

There is low-level industrial production, but the Agents have seen to it that rapid industrialization is unlikely to take off during their watch.

Wealth is understood by the vast majority to refer to the social standing of a family unit, an extended family unit, an alternative such “tribal” group, or a traditional hierarchy.  There are enough multiple threats to daily existence that consideration of using “wealth” solely to “accumulate more wealth” is just not something that would seem sensible in most contexts.  Even in communities with a strong hierarchy, where the leaders are obviously being rewarded, they tend to be seen by the group members as protectors of the group who are being justly rewarded for that role.  And often they are exactly that. Think more “wise sheikh” than “feudal lord”. 

The Riders are much more trade-oriented than the Heliops, who have very much a “state-centrist” approach to economics. But the Riders are also monopolists who have little sympathy for those trying to compete in “their” markets.  The mining communities Eelan are effectively voluntary vassals of the Riders and operate in much the same fashion, while the northern farmers and ranchers are likewise under the protection of the Helioptic Center and tend to work and think in much the same way. 

Much of the southern and far western lands are very agricultural and rural. And of course, much “barqier” than in the north.  Barter is prevalent there. The idea of “wealth” is tied almost entirely to the success or failure of the harvest or the hunting and gathering.  There is a lot of “naturally-occurring” mutual aid, as well as traditional hierarchies.

It is in the eastern provinces of Beavertoon, Wye, Mobalbesq, and (to a lesser extent, and in somewhat different ways) in Oobar, Blubaroon,  Eebar and Kahilabarbakal, where a more mercantalist culture has some solid roots. It is common for shipping-based enterprise, both on the seas and on the rivers, to pay their crews wages in cash, for example.  The managers of these enterprises tend to have a sharper sense than many others in the Saskan Lands of the advantages of “buying low and selling high”. To the annoyance of both Riders and Heliops, they will encourage competition between Inns and so on seeking to buy fresh seafood and other aquatic products.  Finally, it is only in these areas where things resembling “free enterprise”, “insurance” and “credit” can be found, at least in embryo, to any widespread extent. For the same reasons, it is really only in these provinces where we find something resembling “companies” of entrepreneurs (who may bear a strong resemblance in some readers’ minds to pirates…) who may not be tied to any specific guildhall or other institution, not even to a secret society. It also in the eastern Lands where gambling culture is not uncommon. And, finally, along with the almost entirely “criminal” pastiche of the Kahilafolk, the easterners tend to make up the bulk of “gun-for-hire” mercenaries when trouble comes knocking, giving the region as a whole something of a “swashbuckling” elan.

 
Currencies

To facilitate exchange of goods, the main Saskan powers — the Helioptic Center and the Riders Guild — long ago began to mint coins.  Eventually, a form of paper money evolved as well, though it has more the character of transferable Letters of Credit than “currency notes” and tends to be used only by larger, more urbanized enterprises or for more permanent wholesale relationships. 

The busy folk of Beavertoon have also realized the value of a more abstracted kind of exchange. Ever mindful of the dangers of annoying Borded or Besquahoek too much, they have refrained thus far from minting their own specie. They have however, developed a whole set of institutions, relying as usual on the bewildering complex Beaverton legal system, who act, in effect, as guarantors for letters of credit. These in turn, have begun to adopt more of a mass appeal in certain areas, and the authorities have permitted limited runs of such credit markers to be imprinted on materials less flimsy than vellum and other expensive paper-like products, and typically in smaller denominations. 

The Rider and Heliop coin-based currencies are completely inter-changeable and carry the same albeit somewhat odd denominations. The value of coins is always relative to their size and there are universal terms for each of the coin sizes. Given the multi-lingual nature of the Saskan Lands, as well as the various images that have been stamped on them over the centuries, the coins also have a wide range of alternative and local names. They tend to remain in use for long periods of time, down to the point where the images can no longer even be discerned.

Letters of Credit can be for almost any amount, but are typically for amounts that are considerable simple multiples of the largest coins. They carry an expiration date set at issuance, after which point no further names of authorized carriers may be inscribed on them. This applies to the instruments floated in Beavertoon as well. An LoC can be used only by the “carrier” whose name is inscribed on it. These names are added each time a transfer is made and the previous carrier’s name removed. If there is no longer enough space to add another name, it is not uncommon to write in the margins of the document.  Obviously, this is far from a foolproof method, as a thief merely needs to write their name on the document.

The “hard” Beavertoon credits, on the other hand, tend to be in denominations slightly greater than the largest coins, plus a few larger amounts and, like the coins, they are provided in a somewhat bewildering array of amounts. Though the “bit” is the traditional basic unit of currency, many folks think in terms of “shan” units, especially in markets where most sales are for lower-priced items.


Denominations of coins…

trit: 1/6th of a bit (a half-shan)                                 1/6
shan: 1/3rd of a bit (2 trit)                               1/3 or 2/6
ban:  1/2 bit        (3 trit)                        1/2        or 3/6
bit:  Unit currency  (6 trit, 3 shan, 2 ban)  1/1 or 2/2 or 3/3 or 6/6
nat:  1 1/2 bit      (3 ban, 9 trit)                 3/2        or 9/6
dit:  3 1/3 bit      (10 shan)                             10/3
hart: 10 bit         (3 dit, 30 shan)         10/1      or 30/3 

Beevertoon hard credits are usually referred to as “chits”, though they have a variety of alternative names as well. Common amounts are usually described as follows, always with “chit” afterwards, like “nit chit”, “hart chit”, “ent chit” and so on.

nit:   7 bit        (20 shan)      7/1   or  20/3
kut:   7 1/2 bit    (25 shan)      9/1   or  25/3
hart: 10 bit        (30 shan)     10/1   or  30/3
ent:  16 2/3 bit    (50 shan)     16+2/1 or  50/3
cue:  20 bit        (60 shan)     20/1   or  60/3
sup:  33 1/3 bit   (100 shan)     33+1/1 or 100/3
log:  100 bit      (300 shan)     100/1  or 300/3


 
Exchange Rates, Prices, Money Supply

(Work on this more...)

Guild-related prices are mostly set centrally, though this is subject to both good communications and a willingness to obey the center. Price of agricultural goods tends to fluctuate from season to season. Open-air markets often permit open bargaining, though it is more restricted in Helioptic areas where the authorities “suggest” certain price ranges. 

Money supply is directed by what are effectively central banks and mints in Borded and Besquahoek, with the Beavertoon “Board of Accountable Governance for the Oversight of Fair Trade and the Security of Exchange” acting as an important secondary (or even primary) credit market. They don’t issue currency, but they do collect it, along with other “rarities”, as they call them, and hold them as backing for their letters of credit and their “hard chits”.  Whether they actually have hoarded enough to fully pay out should there ever be a “run” on chits is not known. 

There is nothing like a “stock exchange”. Investment in a shipping adventure would be handled directly with the concerned parties in the east.  A rough kind of “commodities” market occurs in several southern and eastern locales when ships arrive in port, at fall harvest time and in mid-spring, when buyers arrive to bid for goods, grain, herbs, etc. The largest ones occur in Barbel, Brokilly, Wye, Morilly and Ingar.

Take into consideration:
- Agency management within the Enclosure, influences from outside the Enclosure
- Geography: mountains; east-west, north-south
- Seasons

===

The weather in Saskantinon is generally warm, but there is a change of seasons.  

Districts closer to the Krbsh Delta and the Bay of Bar, are warmer and can be very humid.  

In western hills and mountains to the north , cooler breezes prevail and occasional strong winds. Tornados are not uncommon.  It sometimes snows in these areas too, especially in the westernmost mountains bordering Aranzen and the Krunkinotto.  

Consider when/where earthquakes and tremors might occur. Decide if / where there might be volcanoes.

Eastern regions get rain fairly regularly.  Both rivers, especially near Deltas, tend to flood every few years. Floodplain of the [Blue] Northern River is given over to agriculture that depends on these occasional inundations.  The Southern River [Barbo], on the other hand, gives way to a complex series of small and large dams and canals, some of ancient vintage.  The Great Dam of Biveroon is a popular destination for travelers touring the Ring for its grand sights.
 
Though it seldom reaches as far south as the Southern River [Barbo], every once in a great while a deep freeze descends on the region.  This is generally considered a time of catastrophe in most traditions, both human and sentient.  The more militant forces of the Heliocastron tend to leverage such hard winters as a trigger for launching pogroms, which is to say an elevated Gleaming, against those perceived to have brought it on due to their connivance with “Moonic” forces.

            <Text>This needs more work…  (what doesn’t?..   :-)

THE HELIOPTICON

This is the formal collective name of the governmental and cultural institutions who control the Helioptic regions of the Saskan Lands.  It is also referred to as “The Helioptic Union”, although strictly speaking that is the name of the collective body of representatives of the various Helioptic Guilds, whereas the geo-political entity they control is “The Heliopticon”.

 
It is not incorrect to characterize the Heliopticon as an aspiring but not entirely successful theological-military dictatorship with important populist tendencies.  Its power is far from absolute.  Nor is its role and influence entirely dire. 

They really do protect the population – especially the human population, but also others under their protections – of Saskantinon from external and internal threats.  Its Central Power, called the Heliocastron, rules over a relatively prosperous and secure region that is surrounded by threats. During tumultuous times, the Heliocastronic Center is perceived by many as a source of stability and protection.


Residents of the Heliopticon who follow the Helioptic belief system are referred to as Helipoters.  Anyone who resides or travels through the Heliopticon is subject to its laws.


THE HELIOCASTRON

Often referred to simply as “The Center”, the Heliocastron is the leading body of the Helioptic Union. It is the Central Committee (if it is a committee) of the Union.  Its membership is a closely-guarded secret. Some believe the Heliocastron is a single person. Others say it is a Triumvirate or a Committee.  It is entirely unclear to most folks how it is constituted. 

The great town of Besquoa, located at center of the Ring, where one finds an impressive Temple of the Sun, is where the Central Offices of the Heliocastron are located.  

Most of the major towns on and within the Ring, including the lands and villages near the towns, whether farmed by free-holders or vassals, is governed by a representative of the Heliocastron.  The local representatives of the Heliocastron are referred to as the Heliocastronic Officers and their residence as “The Office”. 

Titles  and honorifics for Heliocastronic Officers change from place to place, often in recognition of special arrangements that have been made locally.  Such titles include:  Heliocastrophical Governor, High Priest of the Sun, Town Father, Helioptic Representative, Master of the Watch, Sun-Lord and so forth. 

The Helioptic influence is strong in towns to the north of the Ring, but less-so in ones closer to Borded and nearly non-existent in Eelan and other northwestern areas.  

Their presence is tolerated, for the most part, in the southern towns, but they are not given  authority over local laws, customs, etc. for the urban area. There they act more as a religious authority for their community of believers. 


THE WATCHERS

Watchers enforce the gaze of the Helipticon.

In the towns of the Heliopticon (that is, those areas “watched over” by the Heliocastronic Center) everyday power lies not in the hands of the Heliocastronic Offices per se but in those of the multiple agencies and institutions who enforce the Law of the Sun as promulgated by the Center.  The strong arms of the Heliopticon are organized into five guilds: the Day Watch, the Night Watch, the Volunteers, the Agents of the Sun and Heliocastronic Specialists.  [Note: come up with better names using localized and more amusing lingo...]

The Day Watch enforce the sunlaw during sunlight hours. They are beat cops, the visible enforcers of order.  A large guild organized into a multitude of ranks and positions, the Day Watch is active in every major Town except Borded.   Its members usually barrack in a walled compound of their own.  The Day Watch is human-centric (beklek) and gender-neutral (byndir), reflecting Helioptic cultural norms, where performance of gender roles are highly formalized and restricted.  The uniforms of the Day Watch reflect their rank, assignment and location.  But even folks in position of authority or who are partnered do not express gender while on duty.

The Night Watch, as one might expect, works at night.  In the Helioptic theology, their duty is to combat the evil coldness that emanates from the two moons and to protect the Sacred Fire, that is, the sunlight, from the dire influence of the night.  It is a much, much, ummmm, shadier organization than the Day Watch.  Including undercovers, infiltrators, listeners and agents in its ranks, the Night Watch sometimes wear distinctive attire but often try to blend in to their surroundings, especially in towns and areas not under strict Heliop control.  Whilst they share a barracks and a common command structure with the Day Watch, members of the Night Watch are less obviously identifiable than their day-time comrades.  Along with being a very distinct organization within the Watch, they have a more marked tendency towards brutality than the Day Watch.  Like the Day Watch, the Night Watch is officially byndir-only and they tend to be more vociferous in their disdain for any kind of gender display than their daytime partners. 

The Volunteers, as their name implies, are the citizen-militia of the Helioptic community.  Called into service as needed, Volunteers carry out a wide variety of duties, including labor and repair chores along with enforcement duties.  In cases of emergency, they rise to what amounts to the national defense. They are in a very real sense are the citizen-soldiers of the Helioptic Army.  They are much closer to hearts of ordinary Heliopters than the other services are.  

Some Volunteers take their responsibilities more seriously than others, identifying with the bravado of the Day Watch or the stealthiness of the Night Watch, depending upon their instincts and personalities.  Volunteers posted to military camps are pretty much full-time soldiers. Attempting to rise to prominence in the Volunteers is a common path towards apprenticeship in the Watch.  Although still dominated by byndir culture, unlike the official Watches, the Volunteers do not expressly forbid gender expression, nor is it punished. In this they tend to follow more closely “civilian” norms in this area, where folks in positions of authority or who are coupled are freer to perform gender. 


The Agents of the Sun are tasked with being savvy about all activities throughout the Lands of Mantemar (and beyond) which can affect the prosperity and security of the Heliopticon of Saskantinon.  They  organize the defense of the realm, including industry, supply and arms-manufacturing.  The Agents are investigators, detectives, diplomats, bureaucrats, guild-leaders, engineers, analysts, politicians, office-workers/scribes, and managers. They are the professional class of the bureaucracy and among the few who have something of a clear understanding regarding the borders of the Enclosure.


Something of a Praetorian Guard, the Heliocastronic Specialists, as their name (and let’s come up with a better one) implies, provide specialized services for the Heliopticon in general and for the Heliocastron in particular.  Little known to the general public, they are the internal support system for the “Agents of the Sun” and for the Heliocastron itself, providing every type of “special” service needed to ensure the perpetual authority and security of the Center. 


The Watches of the Ring Towns – those towns which sit on or very near to the Great Ring Road of Saskantinon – along with the other armed forces of the Helioptic Union and those of the Riders Council who patrol the Ring and the Rivers, with help too from the eastern seafarers and river rats, provide the main line of defense for the Heliopticon against external enemies.  

With the major exception of Ríkila, where relations between the townspeople and the Watches are extremely tense, the Day Watch and the Volunteers are respected by and large for their role in defending the region from foreign incursions.  Folks tend to have fewer opinions about the Night Watch and the other agencies, whose role is both less obvious and more deadly.


THE HELIOPTIC PERIPHERY

There are a few towns and regions — mainly in the Weyrlands and Eelan — where Helioptic presence is almost non-existent.

The Night Watch tends to get some grudging respect for its role in looking into things that go bump in the night. 

Nevertheless, both arms of the Watch are justifiably feared by sints, the mixt and all those who do not hold to the Helioptic faith. Judgments can be harsh and biased, especially during the Helioptic Festival days and the annual pogram-like “Days of Burning” known as “The Gleaming”. 


ENEMIES OF THE HELIOPTICON

Traditional external threats to the region tend to come from the North and Northwest, in the form of wild beasts, raiders, pirates, bands of marauders, bizarre and frightening forces emerging from the impermissible mountains, and even the occasional full-scale invasion.  From the South and South-East, animal-liberationist gangs, sometimes autonomous, sometimes in the pay of the Krbshanana alliances, pose a potential threat.  Fears that one day they will see a unified, large-scale “animal”-led army arising in the south keep many an Agent of the Sun busy and sleepless.  As will unfold during our story [once I figure out more details… :-)  ] there is a ferocious and monstrous enemy lurking in the Lewshan Mountains to the northeast as well. 


Internally, the Watch tends to be concerned first and foremost with the Kahila-folk, a fairly large and enormously diverse group who mainly inhabit the provinces of Kahilabarbakal and Kahilabek, but are active in other eastern provinces too and play an important role in sea-borne trade. The Kahila tend to be non-believers. many follow or participate in a wide variety of “free”, “independent” and in a good number of cases, clearly illegal trades and guilds, up to and including organizations of assassins and hitmen, some of which are aligned with various “animal”-liberationist militants. 


In a few towns, particularly in the Kahila regions and most notably in the large town of Ríkila, the towns are divided into “Sunny” and “Moony” districts.  Relations between the two camps within these towns are tense.  



RIVALS OF THE HELIOPTICON

Of the larger Ring towns, four of them – Borded, Jook, Biverton and Rikila – along with several smaller towns and a wide variety of villages, some remote, some not so far from the Ring, do not “officially” recognize the Heliocrastron's right to rule over them.   In Rikila, this is disputed — in other words, the Central Offices do assert their “Watchful Rights” but the reality on the ground is different. 

Borded

In the case of the large and well-to-do town of Borded, a contract was established long ago between the “Free Hostelries Cooperative”, an important conglomerate of guilds led by the Riders Council, who built and run the town, and the Helioptic Union, who are permitted to operate there with restrictions.  The Riders Council runs a military organization that provides protection services, paid for mainly (but not exclusively) by the Heliocastronic Offices, throughout the Heliopticon and especially on the Ring Road and along the Northern River [Blue]. Like the Helioptic Union, the Riders Council is dominated by humans (is beklek).  

The two powerful human-run groups have a generally congenial relationship and not a small number of Riders hold to the Helioptic faith.  But especially in their stronghold of Borded, the Riders maintain strict autonomy from the Heliops in matters of military organization, in business, in guild affairs and have a distinct culture.

Jook

Well inside the Ring, surrounded by deep forest, lies the ancient town of Jook.  Bardsongs of ancient Jook are among the best-known in the region.  Jook-legend songs are sung in nearly every village and town of Saskantinon.  While many of the Jook bardsongs are fanciful, the sheer number of such ballads and ditties reflects the place that Jook holds in the imagination of the entire region.  It is far and away the oldest of the towns of the Heliopticon, a fact that is obvious from its strange and tumble-down architecture.  Its old iconic structures, many still showing evidence of building materials of unknown manufacture or origin, predate, possibly by many centuries, possibly even millenia, those of the other towns in the region. 

A quiet, almost mystical place, the Heliocastronic Representative to Jook is always careful to acknowledge the precedence of the quasi-mystical [Order of the Ancient Elders of Jook] in town affairs.  Jook Town is almost entirely populated by Sunny faithful, but this is most often a polite cover over much more ancient beliefs having to do with respect for the Council of Elders.

It is known the Jook was at one time considered to be the location of the Central Office, which was later moved to Beshquok. The theological aspects of that move lie at the center of “modern” Helioptic argument.


Ríkila

Whereas the situations in Borded and Jook are fairly clear-cut, Ríkila is another story altogether.  There the Heliocastronic Offices have been engaged in a state of constant civil strife with the local “Moonic” forces ever since the ceasefire that ended the Event in Ríkila.  The town sits astride the Ring, mid-way between the rivers and connected by a smaller road to the Krbsh Sea.  

Ríkila is an important entrepôt for trade and travel between the Heliopticon and the populous sentient-dominated Lands to the east – the barely-“civilized” Owshk-speaking region of Lewshanana – and to the south – the powerful Grummik-speaking alliance of the Krbshanana.  Furthermore, all factions, religions, secret societies, banned guilds and malcontents of every description have a guild hall of some sort, often not amounting to more than a seedy pub or disreputable temple, in Ríkila.  It is – some say literally – where worlds collide. 

The town is literally split in two, with one half under the watchful if somewhat paranoid and draconian rule of the local branches of Watchers and the other basically a chaotic and anarchistic bazaar where Oobark is often spoken openly and without fear.


Biverton

The town of Biverton, located on the southern Ring and spanning the River Barbo, likewise refuses to officially acknowledge the rights and privileges of the Heliocastron.  In this case, the majority population – primarily a large, vivacious community of beaver/human mixt who built much of the town – dominate business and politics in the town and also control much of the traffic on the river.  

It is suspected by some that the Bivers, whose Town Council officially espouse equality between humans, mixten and sints and does not militantly promote anti-human politics, are actually  heavily influenced by mountain-dwelling, mixt who inhabit the Aranzen mountains far to the west of Beaverton.  In other words, they are under suspicion by the Helioptic Union (and some members of the Riders Council, too) as being something of a fifth-column for “mutant” Aranzenian influence, rather than simply as a front animal-liberationist sints per se.  Unlike Ríkila with its frequent rounds of protests and street brawls, occasional uprisings, and its noisy bazaar and an infamously bawdy night life, Biverton is relatively peaceful, conservative and hard-working.

Furthermore, the Town is the center of a large prosperous region, called Biveroon, that includes the largest inland sea in the region: Biver Lake. The Bivers dominate trade and transport on both rivers and play an important role in sea-faring trade as well.

The Biverton Town Council considers itself the proper authority in Biverton.  Its leading citizens tend to align themselves with the Night Hall, a guild co-operative that is outright banned in many parts of the Heliopticon.  While most Bivers and the 'The Fair Wind', as the Night Hall is referred to locally, do not openly oppose the presence of the Helioptic Union in Biverton, polite protests against and even occasional boycotts of Helioptic Scribes and Innkeepers erupt from time to time, usually organized by fly-by-night groups with verbose names like 'The Biverton Youth March for Equality and Justice’ and such.    

Bivers are famously argumentative and verbose. They have an extremely complex and litigenous society from a legal perspective.

            <Text>KEY THEMATIC CONCEPTS for a modern story or game

There are some key concepts that anyone living in the real world in modern times is concerned with.  Finding ways to explore these themes in the story, in a meaningful way that leaves room for multiple interpretations and movements, would be a big win. 

These include:

* Love
* Ethics
* Self-sacrifice
* Duty
* Healing

&quot;Do humans deserve to live on this planet that they have done so much to ruin?&quot; -- pretty much the overarching philosophical theme of the epic.  What is this character doing (or not) to reverse the ecocide?

When working through characters, episodes and story arcs, but especially characters and episodes, include notes on these items. They have been added to the Character template. 



MORE COMPLEX THEMATIC CONCEPTS: Psychology, Literature/Art, Culture, Philosophy

Zizek’s book on Hegel dives into a number of ideas for psychological, literary, cultural and philosophical themes that could be interesting to weave into the story. 

The idea of “Enclosure” resonates with the history of capitalism, of course, and has some obvious thematic weight along the lines of reading a story about a set of characters who are, more or less, invented/controlled by unseen observers.  The story itself kind of breaks down  the 4th wall — of authorship (who is telling/directing this story?), what is the role of the audience — as well as playing around with the structure of “god/maker” video games (can I, the player, reach a level where I can help to direct the course of the game?).

In terms of literary antecedents, these concepts resonate especially with works by Brecht and, to some extent, Kafka. In the same way the KS Robinson acknowledges his debt to Bogdanov, perhaps I can nod to Brecht and Kafka. And speaking of Bogdanov (and KS Robinson) I owe them a great debt of gratitude as well. Read up on the Proletcult stuff.  Re-read the piece in e-flux about cops and art.  Think about all the things I’ve tried to say in eRepublik via “PQ” and “RFW” about détourning the game and see how I might incorporate that. For that matter, why not introduce PQ himself as a character?

The Lands of Saskantinon play with post-apocalyptic genres, situating itself in the “zookeeper” kind of style. Humanity (and other sentient life on Earth) is saved (from the “Flood”, canonically speaking, that is, the ecocide) only through the benevolent oversight of a “big Other” (the Agency). But that is also when it gets interesting.  The Heliops fear the big Other, while denying that it actually exists and creating a symbolic appearance (petit objet a) where the impossible resides, using the most obvious metaphor of all, the literal “big Other” — the Sun.  The variety of “stargazers” are more Kantian — understanding the “gap” in noumenal terms, that it is something “out there”, which is fundamentally not part of phenomena as we know it, something “else”, mysteriously “other”, to be “believed in”, perhaps “on faith alone”, etc.  The twist is, of course, that the “big Other” is “real” — in the sense that it does actually exist — but (ha-ha, surprise double-twist) they are rather incompetent and themselves filled with contradiction. 

Our Saskan Hegelians, Derridadaists and Badiouamaticians express varieties of understanding the “not-all” of the Enclosure in more materialist terms:
Hegelians as a “twist” that will reveal the benevolent nature of the Universe, 
Derridadaists: as a “difference” that reflects our own sentient split, possibly illusionary, between subject and object, a
Badioumaticians: as the harbinger of an “event” that will change everything in the blink of an eye, 
…and so on and so forth.

His thoughts on the development of western music are also intriguing. This might help to flesh out the “bard song” and “song cycle” thematic elements, colors of the story.    
Likewise, multiple references to jokes, iconic performances would certainly be in order if I wanted to acknowledge Zizek his own bad self as an influence... 

How to work this stuff into my work methods?  Let’s try adding some stuff to character and scene templates as reminders along these lines? 


HUMOR

In every culture, it is the comic writers and poets who loved most widely and remembered most broadly.  We think some animals play and a few may even have a sense of humor. Ravens, in particular, and probably dogs too.  But while all animals can writhe and/or cry out in pain, it is humans and pretty much only humans, as far as we know, who laugh. 

Have some fun. Let the reader/player have fun too!

MUSIC

Pondering a variety of ways to bring interesting musical themes into both the story telling and the game design.

- Develop a musical theme for each…
		+ Major character
 		+ Major organization or alliance
		+ Major town or region
	  + Possibly explore use of some automation/ML kind of stuff in doing this.

- Put some actual music and poetry behind the already strong motifs regarding song cycles, song catchers, bards and so on.  Try to avoid doggerel, lame verse, banal rhyming. 

- Regarding the trial of PQ and the underlying epic political/cultural conflicts amongst the beks, consider using guitar and musical terminology to characterize at least some of it, creating my own “glass bead game” terms. For example…
	+ First Position — describes the orthodox Helioptic viewpoint. Musical themes use notes, chords, progressions easily obtained in the first four frets.
  + Second Position — describes the somewhat more open, reasonable Rider viewpoint. Musical themes use notes, chords, etc. from the first 8 frets
  + Third Position — describes the even more open view point of the Mobalbesq community, themes using 12 frets
  + Fourth Position — “outside”, “free bird”, “high flying” perspectives, using frets beyond the 12th.

            <Title>Rewards</Title>
            <Text>

Here’s the elevator speech:  Offer rewards for a rich set of less-social and less-creative behaviors that the players already want to do.  

- save the world
- collect stuff (songs, knowledge as well as materials)
- have a better relationship with animals
- fight monsters
- engage with machine learning in a better way
- leap into the abyss

Try to define reward feed backs around activities that the player-(reader) would likely have engaged in anyway, given the game/story context. 

- watch shows, listen to music
- explore

Seek to align rewards to intrinsic desires and provide a path towards the fully intrinsically-motivated behaviors.  

Do all of this using a mixed, complex schedule of events.

- the trial —&gt; slow-moving, deliberate, long-term
- exploring the Ring —&gt; free choices, much variety of challenges and actions
- gathering allies, resources; counter-measures vs. rebels —&gt; strategic warfare
- understanding forces, enemies —&gt; strategic intelligence-gathering
- story-telling and music-making —&gt; creating/making something 

The negative outcome the be avoided is player’s remorse.  This is the drug addiction feeling.  A player (or reader) has been motivated, but not fulfilled and this realization gets worse over time. 

- for every type of user interaction (or story-line), make sure there is a “pay off”
- In terms of story-telling, this might include the basic kinds of thrills but also good twists, getting juicy hints, suspense, getting a piece of the puzzle, meeting an interesting character or turn 

General Observations

I think about “Saskantinon, the Land Between Two Rivers” in terms of both a game and story.  

This goes all the way back to playing the Gamma World scenarios that provided the underpinnings for much of it, when it became clear that the story-telling part of the game-play was what people enjoyed as much as if not more than the role-playing mechanics. Although the points made in the Story Arcs notes are keys to constructing a strong narrative, keep in mind some principles of good game design as well.  

Some interesting guides so far have been Tynan Sylvester’s “Designing Games: A Guide to Engineering Experiences”, O’Reilly, 2013 and Raph Koster’s “A Theory of Fun for Game Design, 2nd Edition”, O’Reilly, 2014.  Both books have a wealth of advice. 

They both note that creativity and creating an emotional experience are key.  This is similar to the Udemy course I did on “Writing for an Emotional Impact: Punch them in the gut”.  Both the gaming and  story-telling need to immerse the reader-player in a world they can relate to emotionally, and which, in some way, helps them to navigate their way through their own world. 

- Keep in mind that telling a reader what emotion is being experienced is really bad story-telling. 

To this end, things that would help might be to include the same story arcs that are in the more structured story-telling, but perhaps providing options, or open-ended outcomes.  
This could also be a way of improving / finding surprises to enhance the story-telling.  

There should be a way to develop a software-gaming interface, or tools, that help to craft story, in much the same way that a good role-playing crew helps the game-master develop a good narrative. 
The idea of an-going feedback loop between game-software-play (and development) and written-story intrigues me.

- Use the “Saskan Eyes” editor to help develop ideas, alternatives, etc.


Motivation and Fulfillment

The very interesting Chapter 8 of Sylvester’s book “Designing Games” deals with this topic, providing a kind of deep dive into (and ending with a problematization of) Skinnerian psychology, showing how it helps to develop a dopamine-triggering motivational feedback loop, the ethical implications of this, and the pitfalls of trying to map simple reward-response interfaces onto complex social phenomena.  
I intend to map some of those concepts to things I’ve considered on the game side of “The Saskan Lands”, but a summary of Sylverster’s key points:

* Motivation and Pleasure are not the same thing. Players (and readers) can be motivated in specific ways, even into very addictive repetitive behaviors. But that doesn’t always mean they are getting pleasure from it.  If the main design goal is to generate money for a game publisher, this can effectively be the same thing as promoting drug use.  At the end of the chapter Sylvester talks about a designer’s attempt at parody by creating a “click a cow” game. To her dismay, people loved it and even kept “clicking the cow” (hoping it would re-appear) after she’d removed all the cows from the game.  

My take-away there is to strive for goals that:

	* Satisfy the emotional needs of the listener/reader/player.  This means things like: providing the means to resolve conflicts, either internal or external ones.   Let’s call it constructing a “melodic” line and a “harmonic” progression (perhaps even literally?) that resolves on the dominant tonic.  
In other words, surprises are great, but ridiculous endings (or resolutions) are just annoying and dis-satisfying. 

	* Seek to embody themes that will really resonate with audience/s.  Provide characters that appeal to multiple demographics, identities, worlds, and especially to a (vaguely) “proletarianized” class of player-reader who are looking for “impossible” answers to real questions/problems. (See Thematic Tones:Themes)  Provide some kind of hope for a new kind of solution to “intractable” contradictions.  Offer glimpses into philosophy that are not simply banal blandishments, don’t just reconfirm pre-conceived notions/ideology.

	* Offer rewards in the shape of creative work, such as musical compositions, unique communities/families of characters, interesting player and non-player characters, and perhaps a degree of “civilization building” albeit on a smaller scale and within the context of my “Enclosures”. This latter would be something like the “God” role in games like SimCity, Cities Skylines, The Universim, Trainz,… or even Minecraft I guess, but with a specific palette.
Another take on the shape of creative work is the Bogdanovian / Proletkult one. In other words, the creative work should not be stashed away in a “museum” and produced only by “workers in the art industry”, but should be performed “on the street” and produced by “the masses” (So is YouTube a “museum” or “a street”? Hmmm…) 

	* At one extreme, have a strong creative element in a multi-player interaction might appeal to introverts.  In other words, songs, villages, communities, inns, tunes, tools, meals, arguments that are created and “published” or “released” might flow into the mix available to other players.  But they do not necessarily require direct interaction with other players. 
A kind of socially-distanced game play I guess?  
Reward is in creating and seeing adoption stats, seeing one’s scenarios “performed” by, one’s tools “used” by others…


As far as direct rewards within the gaming model, some of the interesting points that Sylvester makes are…

The anticipation of rewards, as opposed to the actual reward itself, is what creates the dopamine reaction (i.e., the motivation to play, to continue to play).  In writing, this would be something like foreshadowing or creating conflicts that call out for resolution or laying out the mystery.  This in itself is not enough. In itself does not spark joy.
In gaming, creating such anticipation without actual reward means people will stop playing.  Good skill and crafting not only provides rewards in a meaningful emotional context (as noted above) but provide the reward reinforcement on a schedule that is enjoyable and fruitful in the player-reader’s world.
In writing, this would be keeping a good pace of posing mystery/contradiction/conflict and resolving it, as well as continuing character development.

The reward reinforcement schedule might have a…

Fixed ratio:  each such-and-such action always results in such-and-such a reward.  This simple version of this is the most banal “drug addict”, “click the cow” kind of interface.   
Variable ratio:  the reward occurs in a randomized fashion. A bit more like gambling.  The player keeps “clicking the cow” in anticipation of “hitting it”.  This may be a sliding scale kind of thing, where newer, less experience players are rewarded more often for a particular behavior, but older, more experienced players get that reward on an increasing random schedule.  And of course, escalating the difficulty of the tasks is a common variation too.
Fixed interval.   The reward occurs only the nth time the behavior occurs (rather like the little “goodies” in Waze).  These are generally poor motivators for on-going play, sparking short-term interest only.  
Variable interval.  The reward occurs after the behavior occurs random times.  Like playing craps.  It’s exciting because you never know when you might “hit it”.  However, there is lower overall chance of a “win” on any given “try”, so players may become de-motivated in the short term, less likely to  quickly repeat the behavior.
Differential reinforcement of low response rates:  like fixed interval but with a throttle against trying to gain the reward too early. Encourages steady but low rate of activity.  
Differential reinforcement of high response rates:  behavior must occur n times within a time frame to get the reward.
There are many other possible schedules, with varying motivation responses elicited. 

Sylvester’s basic recommendation is to engineer multiple superimposed reinforcement schedules, giving the example of Civilization V, where there are as many as 30 different reinforcement schedules going on at any given time. (No wonder I like it so much! :-) ) 
This is what gives that extremely successful game its “oh, let’s play just one more turn” feeling.   There is always something that may provide a reward type of feedback on every click, but seldom always the same combination of things. Some occur quickly, regularly.  Some seldom.  Some within a certain time frame.
It would not hurt to think of this kind of superimposed, variable-length phrasing when designing scenarios in writing too (and music for that matter).

The ne plus ultra according to Sylvester is an emergent reinforcement schedule.   This is when the reward emerges from the nature and style of game play itself.  Chess is the classic example.  
The pace of reward (taking the opponents pieces) is determined entirely by the strategy deployed by the player.  This can be a very boring approach too — a “death-match killer” game is dominated by someone with “the killer joystick” or whatever, who can “kill more cows” than anyone else.  But there is little flexibility or interest other than hitting the top of the leader board.  


  The other interesting thing that Sylvester outlines about motivation has to do with extrinsic vs intrinsic motivations.   
This is where it gets interesting. Ask when providing a reward demotivates the player-reader.  The basic finding is that when players/participants are involved in something they perceive as a creative or social activity, offering rewards at all is demotivating. They come to associate the activity more narrowly (“I only play the piano to satisfy the demands of my teacher”) rather than approaching it joyfully and experimentally (“Playing the piano is fun! Look what cool things I figured out to do with notes and chords based on the A minor natural scale!”).
The “trick” is to find the most joyful, interesting balance between extrinsic and intrinsic motivations, using a complex reinforcement schedule and, ideally, crafting an “instrument” that encourages emergent responses.   



  For my next exercise, I want to try to specify some specific kinds of game actions (and/or story twists) within my game/story context that might address the kind of motivational reward patterns noted above.

            <Title>Powers</Title>
            <Text>I want to avoid a straight Gamma World or even &quot;superhero&quot; or &quot;mutant&quot; type of storyline.  If this were to become a comic book, it would be situated in a different kind of genre.

(What genre is this anyway?)

Nevertheless, there should be some elements of supra-human capabilities arising in some cases. This can easily be conflated with &quot;magic&quot; and so on, as well as theories about the Zeldan influence. The origins of the powers can reside in the more-or-less typical comic book explanations... tied into the overall DNA-mixing theme in a meaningful way, hopefully, along with some &quot;engineering&quot; of ET and terrestrial origins.  In other words, some powers may be coming from technological enhancements rather than biological origins.  

With the &quot;killer bugs&quot;, a wee nod to Starship Troopers, of course, but also tied into the incompetence of the &quot;overlords&quot;.. the arrival of the bugs within the Enclosure is an accident, not part of the zookeepers’ plans.

Likewise, the re-emergence of birds should present a different perspective on powers, as well as on evolution... like &quot;what if&quot; things are re-booted on an avian rather than mammalian basis... what types of &quot;powers&quot; would be considered extraordinary then...

If possible, without getting TOO worked up about or too literal about it, would like any powers to tie to some specific origin and not be, in fact, &quot;magic&quot;. 

Categories of powers

Strength
Large muscle mass
Excellent muscle control
Rapid attack

Speed
Short bursts of high speed

Aromas
Attraction odor
Repellent odor

Bites/Injections/Poisons
Paralyzing
Deadly

 Other? 

Use the Saskan Schema software to inventory, describe, categorize powers. Then pick a FEW that help drive the story.

MAJOR CALENDARS

There should be a Helioptic standard for time-keeping and calendaring that is used or at least understood by most actors.  Then also a southern/Barbo/Oober alternative, as well as a Kahila/eastern one and probably a western/Eelan one too.   Possibly still another one used by the Biveroon. And a universal “star” calendar used by the Agency — and by the software to reconcile the others.

 SOLAR / HELIOPTIC

The original series of &quot;months&quot; I came up with for the Heliops was derived pretty directly from the the tarot deck and the Kabbalah/tree of life, so I'd like to make that more unique to the inherent qualities of the story/game.  I don't mind at all mixing/matching from mystical and religious traditions, but don't want a direct &quot;steal&quot; unless it is for a very particular joke or purposeful reference. 

Here was the original version, with the tarot and Kabbalah references... and some possible alternatives....

Keddar / The Crown		Cheddar
Jokma / The King		The Joker, The Clown
Beana / The Cup
Jexa / Mother of Mercy	(kind of like this one as is)
G'boor / The Book		The Argument
Tifara / The Sword
Netzchad / Victory
Had / The Eternal
Yessad / The Foundation	Azimov
Malkad / The Kingdom
Aelfad / The Fool
Beesad / The Mage

Try using a rhyming dictionary to come up with more unique words.

UNIVERSAL

The Agency’s understanding of time would be considerably different from inside the Enclosure.  That is where sci-fi / space fiction considerations need to come into play, especially regarding relativity, near-light-speed travel and/or traveling vast distances thru space. 
But don’t get TOO carried away with complex physics; it’s not really the realm of this story and the intention is for the Agency to be “not all there” any way.


SOLAR vs. LUNAR

The world has two moons. Given the important role that solar vs lunar understanding plays, there needs to be a solar calendar (the Helioptic one) and at least one major two-phase lunar calendar (the Barbo/Oober one).  Should work out the &quot;actual&quot; astronomy for this planet, including the seasons/weather patterns for &quot;Saskantinon&quot; and make sure the solar and lunar calendars align to it. 

May be able to use some software to compute/estimate some of that.


TIDES


There are three main seas involved in the geography of the region, two very large &quot;Great Lakes&quot;, one of which is tied to a large salt marsh, and several rivers that empty into the seas/ocean.  Some clear sense of tidal events and river flooding patterns would also be good to have, and could also influence the design of some calendars.


MINOR CALENDARS and VARIATIONS

Some of the secret societies, quasi-religious groups and whatnot, as well as particular clans/tribes, may have additional variations, especially with respect to observations of important days and such.


SEASONS, DAYS, WEEKS, HOURS

Day-names, how day-divisions/hours/minutes are named and handled, understanding of seasons / solstices / equinoxes should all be understood for each calendar.

See the Saskan Schema for more details.

1 wayt = 5 minutes

            <Text>Enclosure and Agency

Need to explain all this for myself, even if not explicitly described in the story or game. 

I expect it to be a key theme in the overall epic, revealing its true nature over time and eventually leading to characters &quot;breaking out&quot; of it to explore a wider universe. 

The &quot;Saskan Lands&quot; and most of the rest of the continent are contained in a high-tech bubble of which most residents are unaware. Possibly more than one layer of &quot;bubble&quot;.  

The Agency is an intra-galactic organization chartered with overseeing the safe-keeping and development of damaged systems and civilizations who have nearly wrecked their own planet and may present a danger to the rest of the galaxy.  
The planet where our story takes place is such a place.  The horrific actions of previous generations nearly ruined this planet and several nearby ones and threatened to bring such bad behaviors further out into the galaxy.  
Apocalyptic collapses prevented too much damage, but there was concern that they might re-build and do it all over again.  So they were Enclosed. 

This is far from a well-developed method or science and it is rife with its own ineptness, uncertainties, lapses and so forth.  At its worst, an Enclosed area becomes a kind of playground for messing around with DNA and social controls.  
The Agency are like &quot;gods&quot;, but not necessarily very good or adept ones.  Greek gods at best.

            <Text>The Event in Rikila

Present this a fairly-recent past. Or at least tell it later in the story, not presented in “real time”.  Not quite sure how to fully expound on it.  
In any case, I need to have a clear understanding of it for my own background purposes. 

Pretty much my most popular Gamma World scenario regarding the &quot;uprising&quot; in &quot;Brokiki&quot;.  
It should be reflected retro-actively by showing Rikila as the only ring town who's walls are permanently breached -- where the wind rider forces smashed them down when they came to put an end to the uprising, restore order, and create the divided rule that characterizes the town when the story opens.

Also I like referring to &quot;the event&quot; in a Badiouian way and hope to get geek mileage out of it by incorporating some of Badiou's terminology into Saskan philosophical and political debate and discourse. 
Use this as a trigger for themes on the possibilities for transformative change.

NOVEL STANDARD MANUSCRIPT FORMAT
       by Forename Surname

Part One
Chapter One
     Standard manuscript format is often required for novels
so that work can easily be read by editors. It allows editors
to estimate word count and determine roughly how many pages
will be required to produce a book using the page size, style
and font used by their house. This PDF file was generated
using Scrivener's Compile feature and was created using the
&quot;Novel (with Parts)&quot; project template.
     Manuscripts for full-length novels require a separate
title page. The author's name, address, telephone number and
e-mail address should be shown in the upper-left corner of the
title page, single-spaced. The title of the story should
appear in all-caps about half-way down the page. The author's
name follows the title on the by-line as the author wants it
to appear when published. A real name or pseudonym may be used
Surname / TITLE / 1

and may include initials, actual given name or professional
designation.
Surname / TITLE / 2

Chapter Two
     All text should be double-spaced and left-justified with
a ragged right margin. Paragraphs should be indented by about
five spaces (half an inch) and not separated by an additional
blank line. (It used to be traditional to separate each
sentence with two spaces, but in these days of word processors
this is now less common.)
     A 12-point font such as Courier, Times New Roman or Arial
should be used throughout. In Scrivener, however, you can
write using any font and formatting you choose--the options in
Compile can be used to change the formatting in the compiled
document. In the &quot;Novel&quot; project template, the Compile
settings will deal with changing the font and formatting to
those required for standard manuscript format.
     Top, bottom, left and right margins should all be
approximately one inch, not allowing for the page header. Each
Surname / TITLE / 3

page except for the title page should include a header
comprising the author's real surname, the title of the work
(or a key word from the title) in capitals, and the page
number. In Scrivener, all of this is handled for you by the
&quot;Manuscript&quot; Compile formats.
                               #
     Scene breaks are indicated with the hash character. Do
not simply add an extra line space as this can be missed by
the typesetter. The &quot;Separators&quot; pane of Scrivener's Compile
sheet can handle this for you if you are writing each scene as
a separate text document. In general, this will be handled by
Compile in Scrivener, however, so that you can either leave
empty lines in the text (and Scrivener will insert the hash
character during Compile) or use different documents for
different sections (and Scrivener will add the hash between
them).
     Some editors and publishers prefer emphasis to be
indicated by underlining rather than italics. In Scrivener,
this conversion can be handled by Compile. The &quot;Manuscript
(Courier)&quot; Compile format will convert italics to underlines,
whereas the &quot;Manuscript (Times)&quot; format will not.
Surname / TITLE / 4

Part Two
                         Chapter Three
     Begin each new chapter on a new page like this with the
chapter number about a third of the way down the page. In
Scrivener, this can all be dealt with in the Compile settings.
In Scrivener, all of this is handled automatically by the
&quot;Manuscript&quot; compile formats.
     Although it is often said that writers should not use the
word-count features of their computers to determine the number
of words in a manuscript, most publishers and editors will
happily accept a word processor word count these days. In
Scrivener, you can insert a word count of your manuscript by
using Edit &gt; Insert &gt; Draft Word Count (for a manuscript, you
may wish to have the word count rounded to the nearest 100, in
which case select Edit &gt; Insert &gt; Draft Word Count &gt; Rounded
To Nearest 100--this feature is used on the title page of this
Surname / TITLE / 5

manuscript, in fact).
     Note that the actual word count will not be inserted, but
a tag that will be substituted for the word count upon export.
In reality, the formatting of a manuscript is often only
really crucial when submitting directly to a publisher--first
time novelists will usually submit to an agent first, and
agents are often less picky about format and will point you in
the right direction before submitting your work to a
publisher.

            <Text>Working log-line for the entire story…

In a post-apocalyptic world struggling to hang on,
a sexy socialist scientist who is on trial for heresy
re-invents birds, bees and butterflies,
saving the nation from extinction.

Possible titles (don’t think I’ve really found “it” yet)…

The Deep End
Enclosures
Extinction’s End
The Pollinators

The Birds and the Bees
The Gleaming Fire

===================================================
In every Act:
Do something funny. At least make a joke.
Know what the goal is. Know how does the Act end before filling in the action.
Tell a truth. In all the fun, paint a real object.
Make me care: emotionally, aesthetically, intellectually.
Never explain an emotion.
Always strive for beauty.

The first Act has an Oedipus/Daedelus pattern to it. 
There is a fall, a rise, and a fall.
Introduce settings important to the whole epic. 
Introduce key characters. 

Multiple small falls and close-ups reveal character flaws and problems. 
Rise in many small ways with joy and wonder, exploring the two rivers and the lands between and around them in more detail, our gaze deepened through the wisdom of Barqo, Mother Hare and other sympathetic narrators. 
A musical interplay creates melodic movement between the Sun and Moons worshippers, between the stern-ness of the Northern Riders and the playful-ness of the Southern Herbalists, with hints of even more “going on out there”. It is difficult and frightening to consider what is Beyond. An ancient story underlies the relations between east and west, between north and south.
As we meet travelers on the ring road and the rivers, as we peer down those crossroads, and get to know more of the towns a sense of the unique musical surprise inherent in each of them starts to emerge, along with a sense that our journey itself may be plotting out some new probabilities. 
A first glimpse of the the eastern port towns on the Krbsh Sea, and of the confusing energy of Biverton, lends a note of adventure to the whole mix. Nothing is certain. Things could change. There is even more going on.
Birakay, Buckie, Showan Beaver-Wing and Azron Gurdon introduce some humor, and a much stronger strain of sex appeal than we’ve seen before.
The first deep dive into the legal and philosophical struggles between the Heliops and the Bivers leads to rich veins of potential code-breaking.
Hints about the western lands, discovering a bit about New Harvest’s unique relationship to the southern lands and its utter separateness from the human cultures of the north, central and eastern zones leads to even ore questions and wonder.  We start to have hope.  
And from there we learn that there are indeed, still other lands and even more remote and mysterious places: the Aranzen, High Weyr, the autonomous lands of the western hills, the Krbsh Sea and so on, leaving us with the sense that on the margins of the somewhat bleak world of “safety” created by the Heliops and Riders, there is much more wonderful and waiting.

Perceive failures and flaws among the hopes and dreams of…
Barfalot. The Mages and Bards
Set in an eastern inn or two or three, Barqo’s background story takes us on a quick tour of the Lands.  We learn the lay of the land as he recounts his efforts to gather songs and surprises.
The Kahilafolk.  The songs of the Kahilabarbakal. The basami and bitami culture. Hints of the western lands.
Kirill Geckster opens the ornate door to the swashbuckling east. 
The predominance of the eastern gangs is threatened by the rise of Monmar Massachawa. We hear for the first time of the complex history and politics of east vs. West.
Mur’ray gives us a sense of why the Kahila are often feared, the true depths of treachery, and the first distant themes of Lewshanic shadows.
The rebels of the Animal Liberation Front (which I will give a cleverer name…)
Mother Hare sings of the strange beauty of enhanced rabbits, the touching tragedy of young rabbit militants taking on battles they cannot possibly win, and praises carrots. 
The Riders Guild. The great Town of Borded, 
The tale of Iohane and Henqu brings both grandeur and meloncholoy to bear, as we travel around the Ring Road with them, getting familiar with the song steps, the unique contributions of each of the ring towns, and glimpse the sights and sounds of the rivers and the roads. 
Seeing the paths crossing the Ring, and encountering, especially at those crossroads, the languages, song traditions and people from the lands between the rivers and beyond them, we start to patch together a tapestry of the whole of the Saskan Lands.
How sints and southerners can get into trouble in Heliop territory.  The dark side of Helioptic justice and duty. Mizry.  The Gleaming.
In Givakala, we learn the story of Kam, providing a deeper look into Helioptic customs and culture, with hints of secret societies at work on the margins. 
In Heliohlan, the distressing story of Kahrn emerges. Through their troubles, we are introduced at a deeper level to the Herbalists, to southern culture more generally, including the first hints to the reader about the problem of having no birds or bees, and we learn about Terpinol for the first time.
The perspective of Giltraq, just doing his job in Mizry, opens a vista on to the strangely beautiful plains of ordinary mindfulness. 
Having led the reader to both fall in love with our Lands and their inhabitants, and perhaps to have developed some unloving attachments as well, we then drive home that it can all vanish into dust. Persistent existential threats from Wesshewen (barbarians), the Krunkinotto (the created ones / the machines / the bugs), and Lewshanana (monsters and shadows).
Rois tells his frightening tale and reveals some of his anxieties too.
And that is only the start. We Fall kinda hard, seeing how all this affects some of the regular folks the lands…
Looking out from the Helioptic center, from the perspective of Besquohuk and Jook, the Days of Gleaming arrive and we see the passion of the two “fallen” Riders whom we’ve come to know.
We see Allane escaping towards New Harvest.
We see Qu’rub’s longing for a better life.
We see Bu’ruq, deeply unhappy, making fun of the whole mess.
And we meet Rollo and Remanj, who are preparing for the next great conflict.

Act Two is a Man in a Hole trajectory, with a Cinderella start. There is a rise, another rise, then some falling and rising, followed by a rise, then more falling and rising, a long rise, and finally a literal rise.

Alternate longer chapters with series of shorter ones.

In Act Two, we learn a lot about the southern and western cultures. Weave in a bit more with Bucky/PSQ too — we want to explain all the hard work done by the pollinators, and provide a foundational explanation for how all the various winged creatures are brought back to the lands.


1. Oh What a Relief It Is  OR  The Rising in Beshquahoek
(Beshquohoek, ..) 

This act starts with the rescue of the fallen riders from the terrors of the Gleaming. With help from a cast of characters who are not entirely working in tandem, they are freed to ride again. 

The rescue revolves in some way not yet entirely understood to the rising in Rikila, which we start to learn about in more detail. The near-following sections introduce characters involved, at least peripherally, to the rescue.


2. Kissing Cousins

Introduce the tale of Dex and Biff, taking us deeper into the east/west theme and exploring more about the Jaxen world. The rise here is, well, umm, you know.


3. The Glorious Sky

Introduce Mikel Moballeq, foreshadowing the long rise later near the conclusion of this act.


4. Sniffing Out the Problem 

Barfalot and Waleran gets help from a shady crew, including Barq of the Rob-Eye. Pursues technology and alliances that will help to undermine the influence of the Heliops without weakening the humans so much that they will be open to attack from outside of the Enclosure.

Waleran is sent on a mission to spread the lyrics/song of Birakey’s new song.

Introduce Morning Thunder (better name?). A greater journey gets underway. Picking up from the movement of Act One, we continue around the Ring.

Just when it all starts to make sense, and we think we’re on a standard D&amp;D sort of sci-fi adventure, we meet PB. Who is just moving on a completely different trajectory. 

Provide a vignette on Snek as well.


5. Mother Knows Best

In synch with the repercussions of the rebellion in Beshquohoek, ongoing steps towards liberation are taken by Allane, Kam and Kahrn. (This may be 3 separate chapters.)

Heliohan and Barbol — Kahrn 
  Givákala — Kam
  Bordakal and New Harvest — Allane
	 
May need to review, enhance their stories in Act One for this to make sense. 
The idea here is to show their own individual “rising” related to the rebellion in Beshquohoek. 1-2-3 are an inter-related collection tying together the rising in Besh with the history of the rising in Rikila. 

Chapter 4 (or 4a, 4b, 4c) is a fast-forward — news of the rising has had time to percolate around the Ring. We see how it affects these 3 characters. It might make sense to push this section further down in Act Two, so there’s time to explain the events in Besh a bit more. 



6. A Hunger for Madness
(The southern Ring - Wye, Barqton, Biverton, Kunstol,Barbol, New Harvest) 

As the greater journey starts to roll along from east to west, our various heroes and anti-heroes encounter numerous difficulties and some losses. Each explores the dark deep pool in their own way.

Exploring the death drive in some detail, they each pursue an impossible goal. Acting “as if” it all makes sense, against all sensibility.

The so-called Wind Lords (or, as Jesse K calls them, the “Windy Lords”) enter the picture for the first time. Explore some of the underground caverns of the western lands. Get the first glimpse both of where new solutions, new technologies might emerge from.

First glimpse of what the Enclosure really consists of.


7. Rolling Along the River

As one group of adventurers -- Zadane, [Morning Thunder[, PB, Allane — travels to the west we get to know about the Terrpins and other exotic creatures of the southern lands.

The distinction between the Blue and the Barbo comes into focus.


8. Sailing On the Seas

Another group — Otto Trucent and Gallex, and Luvcando the Shanowan -- heads east, out into the Krbsh Sea. A sea voyage takes place. Rising and falling on the waves, we start to learn a little about the rest of the world, a meet other evolved sintients, and we get even stronger hints about the Agency and the Enclosure. 

The ship may be lost, but it’s not. 
The Sea may be full of monsters, but it’s not.

The Krbsh Sea is home to some important new friends — taking us all the way back to the first scene with the octopus barmen. 

We may fall off the edge of the world. Or pass into a realm of horror and radiation.  But we don’t. 


9. Wing Island

The new tech is philosophical — an internal evolution is revealed, not expanded consumption but expanded sharing.

The new tech is engineering magic -- the miracle of flight.

A type of creature missing throughout the story so far appears -- those with wings.  The avionics have a messianic mythology focused on the Awakening of Cereb, a flying snake.


10. High Weyr

As the western tour continues up into the hill country, we meet folks at High Weyr who have some anti-grav abilities. 

Maybe levitation. Maybe they are holographs. Maybe they have mastered some type of flight or magnetism? Or something else?  It turns out there really is something to their windiness. 

Continuing to explore the underground tunnels of the western lands, plans are revealed for gliders, kites, balloons, parachutes. All those kinds of things that have been carefully denigrated and misdirected by the Agents. 


11. Good Morning, Saskantinon

We literally rise out of hole. The first balloons rise. The first birds return to Saskantinon as the ship returns to harbor.  

Let’s get a bee, bat, moth, butterfly resuscitation theme going too.
It will revolve around a collaboration between Herbalists and some “Free Jax”, engineering bees (and maybe moths, butterflies, dragon flies, etc.) back into life, turning the “scary bugs” motif around in a surprise.

Act Three is a Cinderalla scenario, with a class-retro sci-fi twist at the end.

Big rise, big fall (several in quick succession), stumbling but steady rises, a big fall, a big rise (several in quick succession), and small “stay tuned” fall at the end.

The various flotillas, on land and sea, launch towards the Center, while the basimi, bards and biverfolk lay the groundwork for introducing meaningful change.  It all looks promising and exciting when…

Fall, fall, fall. 

Trouble strikes from multiple directions. An uprising of the machines is launched from the Krunkimotto and suddenly every Dax is an enemy agent. Barbarian gangs and nomads sweep in from the Weshewen plains — we’ve heard about them over and over, always in heroic terms. Now they have arrived to take advantage of the difficult times and they are terrifying. The outbreak of “monsters” in Lesshewan causes major problems in the Northeast and a similar “outbreak” in the Forg makes waves for our new-found seaborn friends. 

All of this brings the core political problems to a head. To be seen to be undermining the Riders and the Heliops at this juncture would not only be unpopular; it could very well embolden the enemies at the gate. 
The resistance is slowed down and put on hold in some areas. And in other areas it is betrayed, and not only by the Daxen among them. 
All of this happens quickly, like a car crash or a chase scene. 

There is trouble everywhere as a new synthesis begins to take shape. Resistance is redirected to the defense of the lands. The sea forces, with their octopus leaders and flying forces direct the drive to push monsters back into the Forg. The Riders and Heliop Volunteers defend the northeast against both barbarians and machines. The basimi, Kahila and non-human sints go to the rescue of towns in the northeast, providing a front-line against the monsters pouring down from the Lewshan Mountains. We see the gentle heroism of folks like Zada, Remanj and Rollo. 
Far from the center of things, the Windlords and Herbalists get assistance from Aranzen in turning black a flanking southern attack from the Krunkinotto. The conflict in the southwestern hills draws in the Autonomous Riders of Eelan, who thus become aware of the considerable advances, discoveries and alliances that have developed due to the machinations of Barfalot, Mikel Moballeq, and others. They defect to the “rebel” side, ending the ancient tenuous harmony amongst the major human tribes.

There is trouble in the Center as a “glass bead game” sort of showdown escalates to an intellectual boiling point in Jook. The eldest advisors to the Helocastron and the most senior and learned associates of the Reformed Beaverton Academy of Historical and Juridical Cacography, both sides influenced various ways by the occult scholars of Terpinol, especially Waleran Tanaraka. We also become aware of the presence of incognito and occulted Agents who are present, detected by the agents and rogue agents we’ve come to know — Azron,Calley Coola, Jesse K, maybe a few others. They reveal themselves, to some extent, in order to influence the debate, by telling parables about worlds that could not be rehabilitated following their Catastrophical Era due to various flavors of bone-headedness.

We being to rise, but then, oops, fall again, seemingly even harder

The Rider and Heliop forces are victorious in the North and Northeast, driving back the barbarians and the machines.  Orders quickly go out to arrest and subdue the basimi-led forces in the northeast. The Helioptic Volunteers start moving en masse East to take over the battle against the monsters. The debate in Jook is interrupted by a team from Beshquokuk who lie so far, so loudly and with such felicity — introducing a new school of argument called the “New Theology of Post-Catastrophic Optimism” (a school that is not new at all, rather a concentrated version of all the old fears and hatreds) — that the Jook Elders are taken in by it.  When the “New Philosophers” announce the initiation of a “New Gleaming”, the attorneys and disputants from the Beavertoon Academies begin to despair and consider leaving, fearing for their safety. Agents begin drawing up reports scheduling the planet for a downgrade.

Rising, but with difficulty. Monsters are retreating from the Forg. Machines are retreating from the southern hills. The flotillas make their way to the key ports and landing sites, preparing now to defend the Kahila folk, southerner generally, and Beavertoon from the “New Gleaming” as reports begin to come in of the first massacres perpetrated against basimi and Kahila squadrons in the northeast. 

Rising with determination. The Riders leadership in Borded, as expected, refuses to have anything to do with the “New Gleaming” but also does not offer any help either in securing the Northeast or in defending the non-human sints and other “heretics”.  At this point, they are confronted by a mass of riders from Eelan, who have been generating something like a general strike everywhere they went as they approached Borded. They insist that a multi-sided alliance makes the entire region more secure, and they at least imply that the combined air and sea forces of the newly-arisen far-westerners and far-easterners could defeat both traditional Rider and Heliop ground forces if it came to that. 

Rise. The Riders agree. Along with Barfalot, Iohane and Henqu make a dramatic appearance at the Great Debate being held at the Box in Jook, offering a New Vision to the assembly. Meanwhile a massive Rider / Eelan force charges into the Northeast, disrupting attacks against the Kahila folk. Together the Riders, the Heliops, the Kahila, and the Airborne Forces drive back the monster hordes.

Rise. Balloons, kites, banners, gliders — and birds — are seen all over Saskantinon, to the astonishment of the Heliops and the Agents, who scramble to rewrite their reports once again. 


Coda.

Deep in the swamps of the Forg, Cereb, a winged-snake arises and surveys her new domain. 

Far beneath the Krunkinotto, a spy-jax reports to Control, displaying diagrams and blueprints of flying machines, who feeds them into a System designing what look like near-orbital trajectories and developing something like rocket fuel.  </Text>

Very Old • Near the rivers

Role in Story
Along with the Botos, help to develop a sense of life along and in the rivers. Get another perspective on non-humo sint life, this from a group that is non-confrontational but simply endures. 

Goal
Provide some refuge from troubles and chaos.

Physical Description
Like all the Terrapins, she is about 20% turtle DNA. Green skin and purple shell-like appendages in places. Very old, looks something like the portraits of Harriet Tubman wrapped in a blanket when she was ancient but still fierce.

Personality
Wise old woman who knows things. Is a leader of the Terrapin Clan, which is organized much like the Haudenasaunee Confederation, in the sense that only females can vote on important matters. 

Occupation
Terrapins are considered to be excellent servants by certain higher-class Heliops.

Habits/Mannerisms
Quiet, hard-working. Lots of strength and endurance. Slow-moving. Technically very adept, but in an unassuming way. 

Background


Internal Conflicts
Has lost many children, grandchildren, etc. to poachers, bandits and enslavers. Carries a great burden of memory and a smoldering resentment. 

External Conflicts
Working on a plan for liberation of all captured Terrapins, but wants to resist use of violence, which puts her at odds with Alfers, and Kahila rebels.  Natural allies of Botos and Biveroons, though more interesting practical solutions than the Bivers.

            <Text>The naval flotilla stops at the Barbo Delta to pick up advisors from Biveroon, then at Selaron to drop off supplies for the defense of Rikila. 
As the ships approach the Bay of the Blue, they spot creatures pouring into the Sea from the Forg and the Lewshan.   
The landing at the Towers of the Blue Bar is done surreptiously and quietly, with many of the non-humo sints swimming up the river towards Ingar rather than exposing themselves to detection by Heliops at the Blue Bars.
After having checked in the warriors led by Otto Trucent and examined the documents provided by Luvcando the Shanowan, the Sea Watch at the Blue Bars is thrown into shock when they see  raven sints flying towards Ingar.  

They are even more appalled when the gull and pigeon sints arrive on the docks, arguing and carrying on, as they do.

            <Title>A Rising</Title>
            <Text>On the side of a Mount Eelan, its imposing eastern cliffs visible equally from Eelan Town and New Harvest (Lavega), not all that far from the Ring Road, marking the line where the Great Wall of Fire subsided centuries ago, an enormous portal slowly slides open. 

Displacing rock, dirt, trees and shrub, a small avalanche of debris cascades downward as the giant doors, their movement driven by some unknown internal mechanism that — given the size of the doors — itself must be on a scale nearly unthinkable in most of Saskantinon. The grinding and screeching of the mechanism echoes through the hills, sending animals scurrying and causing sints far and wide to look towards Eelan in wonder. 

As the terrible sound screeches to a halt, travelers on the Eelan Road stop and stare, at a huge cloth-covered wagon emerging from the side of the mountain. It moves smoothly, in an unworldly fashion, more like a ship than a wagon.  And making no sound at all. 

Into the air.

Drifting out of the side of hill like a cloud. The size of an enormous boat of the type that could only be sailed on Biver Lake, or one of the Southern Seas. 

The … thing … drifts straight out from the side of the hill, not falling, not rambling down the side of the incline as a wagon would. A cabin of sorts hangs from below it, and there is smoke coming from it, and the dancing lick of fire. 

When the enormous wagon clears the mountainside, it drifts upwards towards the clouds. On its sides, carefully embroidered into the sails, visible for dozens of kicks in every direction: the Royal Seal of the Lords of New Weyr (which is…?).  

“It’s the Wind Lords!”, a traveler gasps, pointing up at the sky. 

“They’re real!” 

From the peak of Mount Eelan, a shadow moves. Something odd. Moving around in the air like smoke or ash from a fire. Some things!… are soaring high above.  In the air! Like a kite. But moving determinedly, in a steady direction.  And not just one.  Not just several. Are you seeing that!?  A flotilla of gliding things.

Those with far-reaching eyesight could discern that each of the flying vessels was carrying a sint of some kind.  And they were making a subtle roar. 


Azron Gurdon began to record what he was seeing, whispering furiously into his recording device: “Tuke Forsake Me! Blast-it-all! They’ve tuking done it. Notify Planning immediately! And schedule me for a pick-up.  We’re going to need to re-evaluate everything. Tuke-in-Ganymede and throw me in a black hole!! They’ve figured out flight.  And right under our noses too. Collapsing Galaxies!”

            <Text>Hyppofarge
Indeterminate • Time Village

Role in Story
Relate historical materials by reference to items that have been preserved in a honey-like substance. Since there are no bees in the Saskan Lands, this also foreshadows and opens up the question of where are the flying things. Where did the honey come from?

Goal
Give a perspective into “Restorationist” cultures

Physical Description
Human appearance with the slightest hint of bee-like DNA in general “busyness” of character, very organized nature of the villagers and the way they use dance to communicate information 

Personality


Occupation
Leader of the village, keeper of the Time Jars — items preserved in a viscous substance inside sealed, translucent containers.

Habits/Mannerisms
Loquacious, talkative. Likes to gather information of all sorts. Workers and Finders are constantly reporting in. 

Background


Internal Conflicts
The Time Villagers don’t know clearly where the Jars came from, how they were made, or what the substance in them is. This has led to many internal debates about their nature.

There are some signs of bees about, but folks are not clear on what these are.

External Conflicts
The Agency keeps an eye on Time Village and other “Restorationist” type enclaves, introducing misinformation campaigns from time to time if the villagers start to get too close to the truth about the Enclosure.

Notes
Increased points for reaction, mental accuity. Favorite weapons are “stingers” — short, sharp sticks.

            <Title>Rillbeck the Runner</Title>
            <Text>Rillbeck the Runner
30-ish • Along the banks of the Blue

Role in Story
A tasty villain of no particular consequence, Rillbeck the Runner is the kind of powered mixed-sint whom puros love to hate.  

Goal
Provide a somewhat funny foil for heroic stories about Riders, Watchmen and Volunteers.

Physical Description
Enormously obese but very fast, Rillbeck propels himself quickly along the banks and over the water by generating both gas and heat from his body, creating, in effect a fart-propulsion system. 

He also has the ability to launch a kind of fear-based sonic attack by expertly imitating the sounds of various scary things — wild beasts, barbarians, and eerie other-worldly non-harmonic twelve tones and whatnot. Not to mention the smell.

He is also quite strong, especially when threatened.
Personality
A bully and a thief, with rapacious appetites for food. He’ll also steal/sell stuff.

Occupation
Has a burrow along the river Blue, between Khaliro and Rutonik where he hides out and stashes stuff.  Commands a small guerilla of like-minded river rats (i.e., part-rat sints who thrive along the river). No loyalties.

Habits/Mannerisms


Background
Deeply disturbed, Rillbeck is the result of an experiment gone awry. He has no sense of parentage, his mind having been wiped at an early age before he escaped into the wild. 

Internal Conflicts
Persistent nightmares. Feels abandoned and un-loved.

External Conflicts
Constantly hunted by both Rider and Heliop authorities. Not looked-upon kindly by Kahila or basimi groups either.  Lots of petty conflicts with rat-troops too.

            <Title>Grim Malek</Title>
            <Text>Grim Malek
Probably about 14 • Isle of Wye

Role in Story
Give some interesting character to tales of Wye, which has a weirdling sort of nature.   

Goal
Help to engineer the supply of the Krbsh Flotilla once it returns to land.

Physical Description
A cat-sint with distinct feline features, with the nature of a somewhat snarly “bad luck” black cat.  Also has a partial carapace, a sort of retractable body armor and helmet. Indeterminate gender.

Personality
Grumpy, bitey, scratchy, with a strong independent streak. A kind of rough beauty that can’t be denied. A killer instinct. Able to fade away almost instantaneously. 

Occupation
Import/export. Supplier to traders and shippers.

Habits/Mannerisms
A tough negotiator. Not big on small talk. 

Background
Raised in one of the largest “Thieves Guilds” in the Saskan Lands: the Isle of Wye Free Trade Association (FTA), Grim Malek helps to operate a vast network that includes both licit and illicit operators.  

Internal Conflicts
The feline-ish operators in the FTA are particularly loyal to Grim Malek and form a sub-org within the larger network. There are some, err, cat fights that go on as younger players seek to dislodge Grim Malek. 
External Conflicts
The FTA is often at odds with authorities from Bivertoon, who are sticklers for doing things properly, as well as with competing basimi gangs on the Isle of Wye and in neighboring Mobalbesq.

            <Title>The Fallen Riders</Title>
            <Text> A heavily armed squad of Beshquo day watchers called, only during the time of the Gleaming, the First Day’s Watch, accompanied them every step of the way. The loyal protectors directed their leading examples, Iohane and Henqu, along with eleven other accused to the site of the blaze. In loosely enveloping robes woven from the rough wool of Salorizan mammoth goatfons, ankles and wrists enchained, the prisoners were marched slowly from their dark dank cells, out into the winding alleyways of the Beshquohuk bazaar at the heat of mid-day. 

For the Gleaming, the loyal protectors of the righteous wore rare and expensive armor made from multiple layers of shells of giant Borda arns.  Henqu hadn’t had a good bucket of s’lah in days and needed something to keep himself amused. He considered how the peculiar all-black armor made the day watch contingent look like big awkward bugs. 

Whispering “creepy-crawly bugs” a few times under his breath, he smiled. Though few might recognize that slight fluctuation in his typically stern grimace as amusement, Iohane picked up on it.

The mid-morning sun was approaching its high point, exciting the crowd.  The faithful had traveled to the capital from far and wide for the high holy days. From the fertile fields of Rotannablue, from the deep woods of Borda and from the bloody plains of Givakala, and beyond.  The prisoners heard the crowd’s babble bubbling up from the center of town, gearing up for the rituals.  A hub-bub of excitement. Rhythmic shouting and chanting as they drew nearer.  

Iohane and Henqu had seen Gleamings before.  They’d both been raised in Helioptic broods prior to joining the community of Riders. They knew what was going on. They knew what to expect.  

At this point, a professional agitator from the Heliocastron performs on the great round dias in the center of town, a symbolic representation of the Great Deep Pool in Juuj. The official speechifying, detailing their crimes and the reasons for their punishment, goes on and on, riling up the faithful. Still pouring in from the rural villages of Tobaloon and Borda, the first-timers stare in awe at the monumental architecture and statuary of the Helioptic capital. 

Pure and Ordained Cacographers of the Center practice their trade on every street-corner, chanting the age-old diatribes and slogans, their faces towards the Sun, slowly beating their shoulders and backs with stalks of the giant red spurge, a sun- and heat-loving plant, whose small bright yellow blooms on a dark velvety red background form the core symbology of the First Day.

Iohane surreptitiously scanned the low rooftops for signs of rescuers. Their hopes were not high. 

A last-minute appeal, much less any active interference from the Riders was unlikely.  A public condemnation from the High Council in Borded for having made their relationship known had not helped things. Nor had Henqu’s failure to disclose his “unnatural” powers of persuasion. Their less-than-heroic reputation among the Kahila bands and other rebel types meant that any action on their behalf from a starry quarter was unlikely too, despite Henqu’s quasi-heroic reputation in Rikila.

But. 

Early that morning they’d found a message in their cell. Scribbled on a tiny piece of leathered jackskin in a script used by those who’d been initiated into the prison life of Beet, and in a dialect of Eebarq unique to the camps of Beet and Mizry, it simply read, “Have no fear. Help is near”.

The prisoners march turned a corner onto a slightly less-narrow street, moving closer to the broad avenues of the town center.  Curious townsfolk and visitors lined the way. Jazzed up by Cacographers’ assurance that the burning of sinners would cleanse their own souls. Anticipating the day’s entertainment.  They stared at the examples. Some made rude gestures. When the tall and imposing Riders at the lead of the group of prisoners came close to them, more than a few took a step back.  

One worked-up and ancient loyalist stepped forward, though, spit on the ground as the Riders passed and shouted, “Burn for your sins, animal-loving heretics!”

Henqu looked the old codger in the eye. And winked. 

Then he bolted forward as if to attack, straining against his chains.  The befuddled heckler fell back onto his bum-side with a crude oath. The Watch pushed Henqu back with their fancy ceremonial basher sticks. Which had been manufactured by and purchased from, Henqu realized, from the Rider’s Armory in Givakal. 

He laughed loudly.

And started singing.

It was a bit from the obbligato at the conclusion of the tragic “Song of the Lost Miners”, a sad northwestern ballad popular with members of the Bordali Mining Cooperative. Most often sung as a dirge following deaths due to accidents. A long and convoluted tale, its leitmotif revolves around the sneakiness and perfidy of the Royal House of Wind Riders, a commonly-held prejudice held by the miners of Eelan and Bordaloon.

In a loud, clear, ringing Eebar that echoed through the narrow streets, the celebrated singing “Rider You Can Trust”, as he was called in at least a few of the less reputable pubs in Rikila, put on a show for his Helioptic captors and the crowd, intoning in a fine deep baritone:

“They were dead on arrival,
 The Royal post had never come,
 In a hole in the mountain,
 To the sound of the drums,
 They went through the motions,
 That lost miners know,
 In turn,
 In vain,
 They let go.
 They let go.”

“Shut your tooky hole, you star-spun heretic,” a junior member of the Day Watch barked at Henqu. Having bravely put down the disgraced Rider, the young guard looked around with a grin for the approval of his mates. Who seemed to be ignoring him.

Listening to the confusing murmurs arising among the townfolk following the young guard’s rebuke, Iohane understood in a flash then that Henqu had just done something entirely unusual for a Gleaming. He’d taken it lightly. He was mocking them. Refused to show either contrition or fear. It had confused the watchers and the crowd.

The imposing Rider tossed her head back, throwing off the itchy cowl. 

Glaring at the junior with all the fierceness that a hardscrabble upbringing on the Norgyte frontier instills she shouted at the junior loud enough so that everybody on the street could hear,  “Let him sing his song, you measly excuse of a Guard-fart! The Sun must’ve been behind clouds the day you were born! The Rider Henqu is twice the warrior you will ever be, you scrawny pipsqueak of a shit-stained ratfon!”

“Let him sing!!”

Taken aback by Iohane’s ferocity, the senior Day Watch again hesitated before moving to push her back and pull the cowl back over her head. They further stalled their blows when cries erupted among folks in the crowd, startling them,

“Let him sing! Let him sing!”

Not missing a beat, Henqu launched into a rendition of a rather silly tune recently made quite popular throughout the northern and eastern lands by Birakay, the popular performer from Qurol. Derived from a rather raunchy “riding song” of the Kahilabarbakal Song Cycle, Birakay had dialed it down to make it acceptable in the more open-minded hosteleries and inns of Qurol, Sungyte and the other more cosmopolitan Helioptic venues close to the Ring. 

It was the kind of song young Heliopter could sing and feel a bit rebellious. But without immediately incurring the condemnation of a Lawful Scribe and creating possible troubles with the Authority.  

It even had one line sung, rather shockingly for a Helioptic audience, in Ooberq.  Iohane joined in with Henqu on the chorus.

“Oh, we are rough and ready riders,
 We love to drink our cider.
 Hey, listen to my Ooberq
 As we ride through the stardark

 From time to time!
 From sea to sea! 

 Don’t get in our way!
 Or soon you all will pay.
 Go to it! Face the music!
 Don’t be stupid! Fire away!

 From time to time!
 From sea to sea!”

It was a clear provocation.  While many in the crowd were laughing and a good number of younger folks lining the way had started singing along, most were furious.  

The song ended as the First Day Watch, having recovered their composure, rained blows down on the excommunicated Riders. A bit of mayhem rippled through the crowd as people shouted and yelled and those further back pushed forward to find out what had happened.

            <Title>Songs and Themes</Title>
            <Text>Music and song, especially song cycles, play a primary role in both entertaining and informing the population. 

For each region/culture, develop a “canon” of songs, in a particular style. 

Have some characters, like Birakay, whose main contribution is performing and coming up with newsong.

Others, like Barqalot, are songcatchers, who travel the Lands collecting the stories (songs) of the actors.

I’d like to drill into this pretty deeply, including things like assigning a standard Key and perhaps various musical traditions, to a region or town, that would play out in their music, in words used when describing that area, and maybe in software as tools for creative construction.

Short of composing music for an entire movie, all characters, settings and so on, one thing I can do to move in that direction is use the vast array of sound banks available from Analog Lab (the Arturia software) to create soundscapes with various qualities. It is fun browsing thru these sound banks and trying to associate sounds, sound effects with different places, actors, groups can even help in developing a feeling for, some nuances about characterizations.

The “banks” in Analog Lab are thematic collections of short musical themes, tones, algorithms that can be played on the midi keyboard. Sometimes they are very much just like sound effects, other times they create a specific mood. In addition to the 3 “banks” I’ve browsed around in, also definitely check out the:
* Sequences
* Drums —&gt; Drum Kit

And

* Sound Effects —&gt; esp. Machines, Robots

Available in Analog Lab.

It would of course be cool to have melodies, keys, melodic and harmonic patterns associated with settings and actors. But just having a simple phrase augmented by these banks would be a great initial step. Consider developing just a few melodic themes (perhaps when practicing scale patterns on the guitar), then mixing them up by using the banks and other effects.

The 3 “banks” I explored are all available directly from the basic Analog Lab app and are called…
1) Pigments 2.0  	 (P2)
2) Analog Factory     (AF)
3) Factory		 (Fac)

There’s about 2 dozen different synth simulators too. Each has dozens of modes. And everything is adjustable in various interesting ways.

            <Title>Animal Liberation Front</Title>
            <Text>Animal Liberation Front
Militant, Revolutionary • Many small cells

Role in Story
A little bit Monty Python, a little bit sympathetic animal-centered story-telling.
Push on the human / others-with-consciousness boundaries a bit further.

Relationship to Other Organizations
Amorphous and multi-faceted. Bitterly in conflict with Heliops and Riders and other human-centric groups.  Mixed support among mixed populations. They are the far-left (or maybe the far-right) to Biverton’s liberalizing reforms.

Description
A widely dispersed movement, hardly a “Front” at all. Made up of many factions, some of which bitterly oppose each other. United in their fear and distrust of humans specifically, but also bearers of multi-faceted long-standing unresolved internal conflicts between carnivore and herbivore/scavenger conscious species, as well as problematizations of “deep ethonology”, dealing with the boundaries between animals with advanced/enhanced consciousness and those with ordinary animal-level consciousness. 

Roles of Members
Guerilla cells carry out various attacks on human and “collaborator” targets ranging from violent assaults to propaganda stunts.  

Types/Personalities of Members
Vast majority are hares and rabbits. Only a few carnivore-oriented cells, though those are the most-feared… wolves, bears, coyotes.  Lots of young radicals trying to impress each other.  

Industrial, Economic or Cultural Role
Minimal, except when the cells are tied into an older, more established network. Mother Hare’s “Food  Thought” network is the most exceptional one and it also provides safe haven, deep underground, literally, for young militants on the run.

Habits/Dress / Mannerisms of Members
Berets and bandoliers are popular. Rhythmic foot-stomping is a trademark protest ritual.

Background
The Enclosure affected a small number of animals by increasing their neo-cortex or equivalent mechanisms, as opposed the much more numerous grafts of animal traits into largely human bodies. Some physiological changes are evident, usually larger head sizes with correspondingly broader neck and and shoulder bones and and muscles. In most cases, spoken speech also emerged at a higher level, though never at the level of human vocal chords. Larger mouths in some cases, with labial modifications, are the obvious markers. These changes propagated especially in the rapid-reproducing rabbit and hare populations.

            <Title>Archetypes and Myths</Title>
            <Text>It doesn’t hurt to create characters who fit archetypal roles. Its a Jungian thing. This helps to match the story up to peoples dreams, to their innate sense of language and myth and so on. It’s why each generation seems to produce the same “type” of actors, who excel in specific roles. 

Getting too archetypal is not much fun, but being aware of archetypes and their influence can help to develop a character, to understand what kind of boundaries they should have, to get a sense of what motivate them.

Some of the simpler, best known ones are:

Young man (or …) on the rise. A little dumb, maybe, but plucky. We want to see this character win, at least eventually. Yang version of “young woman tempted”.
Young woman (or …) tempted. Pure of heart, cute as a bug. Yin version of “young man on the rise”.
The Imp. The clever and resourceful child. Comes in both “good” and “evil” flavors.
The sex goddess (or …).  Yin version of “the hunk”.
The hunk (or …). Yang version of “the sex goddess”.

Next rank includes:

Wounded soldier (fighter, player, …) going back in for redemption.
The troubled sexpot.
The lovable fop.
The court jester.
The wise grandfather (or…).

Then there are ones that I’ll be dancing around with a good bit:

Magic dwarves and elves.
Tricksters.
Sidekicks.
Talking animals.
Spinsters / witches / wise old women.
Wizards.
Falstaffs (jolly gourmands).
Misers.

Especially in film, there are strong expectations regarding who “wins” and who “loses”. If I mess with that, there needs to be a reason why.



Mythologically-speaking, we have a world I which enough time has passed that a working post-industrial, post-planetary apocalypse mythology (or several of them) have had time to mature. Of course they kind of echo the situation in our modern world, with the overall story line arc taking us in the direction of a Gaia-centered, Black Elk speaks kind of viewpoint. 

Dig into the distinction between reason and science.

            <Text>Barqo’s Surprise Celebrations
Also see Setting and Location Sketches
Act One — The Land Between Two Rivers

Book: Inter-alia
Chapters: Not numbered. Title them with the name of a song cycle from the region covered in that section.  

A chapter from this (non-)book marks the start of each book, and 
concludes Act One as well.


Barqo tours the Inns of the eastern towns, distributing the songs he has gathered and following up with contacts related to his information gathering work.

First stop, the Two Moons in Ríkila. Barfalot arrives. A nod to the classic Star Wars bar scene. A wise old grandfather character, Barqo is the story-teller, a narrator whose conversations, tales and songs frame the entire epic. And he’s just a little bit of a wizard. His surprise is information. Good information should always be a surprise.

The Ríkila narration leads into.. 

Book 1 proper, the  Rich Tall Tales of Iohane and Henqu, which gives us a rapid tour of the Ring. 

Telling the tales of the Ring leads into a detour, of sorts, in Book 2, Northward to Sorrow.

Barqo and others make their way to Sellaroon for an auction. Held following arrival of large trading and fishing vessel working the Krbsh Sea, as well as trade delegations from the southern provinces.  Touring the pleasant lands of Free Mobalbesq and setting up camp in Selaroon, a number of characters emerge who will play a bigger role in Act Two.  

Barqo’s narration from Sellaroon leads into the unfolding of 3 inter-related books:

Book 3 - Holidays Among the Kahilafolk.

Book 4 - The Delicious Legends of Massachwa.

Book 5 - The Great Auction.


After the auction, Barqo takes his tour to Morilly, which is on the road the Biverton. The company includes Showan on his way home for a Big Argument, and also Bucky, on his way home to Wye with newly acquired materials for his laboratory. 

In Morilly, we meet Mother Hare and some of her militants, which provides the basis for most of… 

Book  6 - Into the Wye. 

and

Book 7 - The Splendid Boys of the Mobalbesq. 

The final interlude.

In the final installment of the frame-work story, the action coalesces back into real time.

All of our stories so far meld at the events in Sellaroon, in Morilly, and in the dispersal of our characters on the roads to the west and the south. 

We’ve developed high hopes about a green future, 
then had a sad when we realize there’s no birds or bees.

We get annoyed about the treatment of Allane. 
We begin to realize there might be something weird going on with the Jaxen. 

There is a love triangle. Showan’s love for Bucky is unrequited, as is Bucky’s for Biraqay.
We’re all a bit confused by the multiple levels of gender play.

We get some enthusiastic good news. 
We learn that Iohane and Henqu, have traveled east not only on a Rider mission, but a personal one as well.  They intend to rescue Kahrn and Allane, despite the issues this will raise with the Heliopsis.


There are still some tales to tell.  

This time Barqo is listening and gathering, not telling. 



This is where we hear directly from the folks who’ve stories we’ve heard second-hand so far.


Book 8 - Blessed Flames

Roís is a refugee who tells a frightening story.  

Qu’rub longs for a better life. 

Word arrives that Allane has escaped on her own and is headed for New Harvest. Mother Hare cautions that herbalist discipline can be almost as harsh as the Heliops, in its own way.  

Rollo and Remanj explain why they are preparing for war and describe the ominous shadows forming over the Lewshan Mountains. 

As the parties begin to depart Morilly, the Night Watch descends, seizing several ALFies and Bu’ruq. Shockingly, they take away Iohane and Henqu as well, and announce their candidacy for “cleansing” at the upcoming Gleaming in Beshquohoek.  

Barqo abruptly ends his tour. 

Instead of going on to Wye, Biverton and a visit home to Barqton, he makes plans instead to head to Juuj and then Beshquahoek via the Kahilabarbikal Forest.

            <Text>The  Rich Tall Tales of Iohane and Henqu provides an introductory tour of the Ring. 
This Book is broken up in to two parts, the first introduces Borded, the Riders and something of the history of the Lands.  Then Book 2, the “Northern Tales of Sorrow”, is told. We return to the “Rich Tall Tales (part 2)” after our heroes leave Givakalla and Mizry and head toward s

The Riders Guild, the famed town of Borded gallop into the forefront of our consciousness, with its heroic role as defenders and protectors of the Saskan Lands. 
Through the eyes and ears of Iohane and Henqu
we meet other Riders, 
we engage with caravans, 
we learn about the farming culture along the River Blue. 

Starting out in rich, wealthy and vibrant Borded, 
the tour take us to Givakalla,
This leads to a detour in the story-telling…
 Our first look at Heliops country, its legendary history, its mythic traditions. A bit of a sinking feeling may be engendered.
From there we travel to aptly-named Mizry, getting a sense of what the front lines with barbarism really feel like. Our sense of the necessity of the Heloptic Watchers is restored — sort of.



Resuming the Tall Tales takes us on to Rútonik, into the ancient eastern Saskan lands and closer to the dangerous eastern borders of the enclosure.
Then when Iohane and Henqu ride into Ríkila, the theme of their story merges back into Barqo’s narration.
Together, they make plans for the next stop, in Morilly, though neither is entirely honest with the other. 

There is an easy-going motif of fall, rise, fall as we hear the rich tall tales and songs of the northern and eastern parts of the Ring, and first get to know about 
the Riders, 
the Heliops, 
the ancient history of the Saskan Lands, 
about the borderlands to the north and east, 
the Kahilafolk, 
and the Mobalbesq. 

Iohane and Henqu are heroic. 
But. Can you guess which is the likable fool and which the tempted love interest?

            <Text>Silence, Exile and Cunning.
Tales of Sorrow and Suffering.
The Trouble with Kam and Other Northern Tales.
Northward to Sorrow.

Kam is mostly tragic, setting us up for a sympathetic understanding of the Heliopsis, which will then be shockingly reversed.

In this Book much is told for the first time about the Heliopsis, their Watchers and the various barbarian threats, both historically and in the present-day.  The main focus is on the Weshewen and Lewshan borders, with only the smallest hint of what threats may lurk in the Krunkinotto Mountains. 

The problem with the (lack of) bees is encountered for the first time in some depth, as we explore the manually-intensive agricultural methods necessary to keep things growing.  The fear of flying is a theme.

We start to get a sense, for the first time, that “something is out there”, but it is murky, a fear of things that go bump in the night, wrapped up in mythic Helioptic legends about “the deep pool” and official “arguments” regarding the nature of things.

There is a detour within the detour after learning about Kam’s travails.  

Giltraq the Good enters into things when we get to Mizry. A (good) big brother to Kam’s (troubled) little brother, Giltraq gives the first hints regarding the southern culture and the secret societies, as well as an “elevator” to push optimism and mood up that gentle hill. 

Through his crew, we learn more about 
The wild gangs of the Weshewen,
The “bugs” and the Jaxen, whom we’ve encountered briefly in Ríkila, who emanate from the caverns of the Krunkinotto,
The situations in Beet, Mizry and Hadika

Two detours are taken within the detour within the detour.

These movements introduce and reinforce the east-west thematics, 
the duality-plus — two moons — alternatives the main light source — the sun,
And a lietmotif with variations on the trubek songs with their sadness, their grim determination, their heroism,
One always looking outward for courage, to a greater power, to connection with the source,
One always looking inward for determination, to a warrior spirit, to connection with the essence,
Both determinedly anthropocentric, survival-centered, rejecting the inevitability of either “Nature” or “Other” (animal, machine, monster, the unknown “out there”) conquering or assimilating humankind.

One detour spins off to the northeast (towards Beet), the other to the far northwest (towards Hadika). 

Both are reports coming back to Giltraq.  First regard an encounter with various influential Kahila and other underground/opposition figures at Beet. Second regard intense military preparations underway on the northeast frontier, where rumors fly about
dark plumes of smoke, 
Shadows,
loud rumbles, 
creeping, leaping and wraith-like movements in the Lewshan mountains,
Beyond the Enclosure.


Oh yeah, we also hear about the Enclosure for the first time.

Giltraq organizes a crew to go with the Riders to Rikila to spread the word about impending invasion and to collect medical supplies, especially herbs and other medicines available only in the south, tying us back into first Iohnae and Henqu’s and then to Barqo’s narrative.

            <Text>Holidays Among the Kahilafolk

Bu’ruq breaks the rules.

The darker side of things begins to emerge in more deatil. The mis-adventures of Mur’ray provide an inroad into getting to know the ways of the bitami and basiji.

Following the trail of wee swashbuckler Kirill Gecker, proprietor of the Two Moons, takes us to encounters with basimi and basiji and the rich, complex quilt of Kahila culture, in sharp opposition to the symbolic order presented in the first two books.

A new, different, surprising type of “beyond” emerges as well — the shippers, the boat-people, the sea-folk — who laugh, albeit somewhat nervously, at the idea of an Enclosure. 

More hints about the south lands and their large “sint” populations, the other partner/prey of the Kahilafolk. 
The first hints about yet another aspect of opposing, different realities — the industrious and contentious Biverfolk.

            <Text>This book is told entirely by folks telling tales at a gathering in Sellaroon. It melds very much with Barqo’s narrative, while providing some entirely new, surprising musical and mythic themes.

The Delicious Legends of Monmar Massachwa introduce the faraway Weirlands, and provide some evidence to deepend apprehension about what strange things are “out there” in the Krunkinotto. 

A wayfaring stranger tell a wild tale about Harmonies Sung in the Light of the Moons.

Monmar Massachwa is a female action hero sexpot, with a dark, troubled tone. She takes the “otherness” of the Kahilafolk to a whole new level, a much deeper “fall” if you will.  She swims about in the Dark Pool, thrilled to be there, without fear.  Her descriptions of swimming make it feel like flying — and we start to get  a deeper realization of the place this central myth plays in all the various cultures of the Saskan Lands.

The rise, fall, rise rhythm swells as the fortunes of the Kahila are challenged by direct competition for the illicit traffic at the great auction from Massachwas and the Fifth Circle, possibly acting on behalf of the legendary, perhaps mythical, “House of Windlords”.

            <Title>Summary</Title>
            <Text>As the Great Auction of Sellaroon gets underway, Biraqay — a hunk —  performs and we meet the young heroes Bucky (or whatever we’re going to call this one) and Showan Biver-Wing for the first time. 

Lots of strange and strangely beautiful characters — including most of those we’ve already met — mill about, participating in the auction.  Some of them will re-appear as main characters in Acts Two and Three.

Bucky is effectively a younger version of Barqo who will inherit his role as narrator in Act 2.  

Showan is the real hero, I think. Still working it out but I think he’ll be the one who eventually puts all (or most) of the pieces of our mystery together and, being the real hero, will win out in the love triangle of Bucky —&gt; Biraqay —&gt; Showan —&gt; Bucky.  Yes, the Biver gets the umm, well, not the girl, but his true love, in the end.

This book is largely on an elevating theme, rise, rise, almost a dance, love interests emerge, there is buying, selling, exhibiting, shows, entertainments, mad intrigue.  And, true to form, there is a (small) fall, when the freedom of the Mobalbesq is challenged directly by both Rider and Heliop authorities, both of whom interfere with the auction on behalf of the developing war effort.

            <Title>Summary</Title>
            <Text>With Mother Hare, a wise-old woman (well, woman-rabbit), and some of her militants,we start to 
Dig into the language question, 
Learn about the importance of carrots to the underground militant sentient animal community,
Learn what the herbalists spend most of the efforts on, 
Learn about Joanna’s Fortress, New Harvest and the travails of Kahrn and Allane.

Most of this book is tales told by Mother Hare.

The Animal Liberation Front comes into fractalized view, bringing the immense complexities of Sint politics into focus and openly raising questions about whether there might a Force that really is “out there” and really is “greater than ourselves”. 

The southern Herbalist culture is revealed in some depth, both regarding its role in the survival of the Saskan Lands agriculturally-speaking, and in the immensity of its traditional, mythic understanding which rivals that of bekkind. This is a consciousness that flows in its own river, both literally and figuratively. 

And of course, both rivers course around and through the Mobalbesq and other eastern zones, into the Krbsh Sea.

A completely different lietmotif is introduced as the main theme emerging from the Auction, one with even more variations than the northern. 

This is all a kind of “high”. The music is more cheerful, more playful, sillier in some ways. We’re meeting humans and others with powers, many more characters with altered appearances, and quite a few talking animals.  All somewhat hinting at an entirely different solution to the problematization of the anthropocene as posed by the Riders and the Heliopsis. 

Sadness too, of course, as we learn about Allane and Kahrn, but here it is the struggle for ideas, for practices promising great (and practical) transformation, and not so much either fear-based submission to either father-sun or work to become individual-hero-savior as it is “a better way to live”.

This is left as a taste in Act One. Mother Hare returns to her underground lair.

            <Text>The Splendid Boys of the Mobalbesq. 

Following the roads to Biverton and Wye with Biraqay, Bucky and Showan, we learn about the Helioptic Center, the Biverton intellectual-legal community, and the nature of Mobalbeshquish Argument. 

Bucky and Showan debate some fine points of the Law, in preparation for the upcoming Big Argument at the Deep (Old? Dark? …) Pool in Beshquahoek. Both reveals aspects of the anima. 

Biraqay, through performances and interactions with fans, helps to anticipate the stories we’ll be wrapping up in the next and last book of Act One. 

As we get to know Bucky better, drive home that nobody and nothing flies in the Saskan Lands. Azron Gurdon, a wizardy-character, intervenes to prevent Bucky from thinking too much about flight, creating a mystery about who that character is while (almost) literally bringing “Icarus” down to earth.

A Jax acts up, throwing a kind of zen wrench into the idea that we thought we now understood everything. Something of a discordant note. A tritone. Not a recognizable song cycle.

            <Title>Summary</Title>
            <Text>I had thought that this act could start with the rescue of the fallen riders from the terrors of the Gleaming. With help from a cast of characters who are not entirely working in tandem, they are freed to ride again.

But I think it might be more impactful to let Henk and Iohane perish. The attempted rescue fails to save their lives, but it sparks a revolt throughout the Lands that threatens to upset the Helioptic hegemony, possibly re-ignite the old animosities between westerners and easterners, and opens the door to the re-formation of Helioptic argument along Mobalbesquan lines. 

The rescue attempt echoes the rising in Rikila, which we start to learn about in more detail through dialog and flashbacks. 

The near-following sections introduce characters involved in or affected by the rescue and ensuing uprisings.

In poetic terms, introduce words evocative of “rising” as that will be the ongoing theme of Act Two. Some kind of “lady in the lake” metaphor would be appropriate.  

Use the mythos of the dark pond, dark lake, cenote — the ancient secret of Beshquahoek — as the central motif-making “factory” for each Act.

Introduce Morning Thunder (better name?). A greater journey gets underway. Picking up from the movement of Act One, we continue around the Ring.

Just when it all starts to make sense, and we think we’re on a standard D&amp;D sort of sci-fi adventure, we meet Panda Bearbek (PB). Who is just moving on a completely different trajectory. 

With PB, we get introduced to a lot of new ideas, approaches to things. She is a main character, a hero. Drop “MT” as a central character. Make MT more of a sidekick to PB. The “giantess”. One of the “old gods”. A former Titan. Look at some of the Greek legends for inspiration on MT and PB.  

Provide a vignette on Snek as well, where we get a perspective that is even farther removed from the main ones. In the case of Snek, it is largely for humorous effect, and for something like a “chorus” to reflect — however oddly — the flaws and so on of the more central characters.

Introduce the tale of Dex and Biff, taking us deeper into the east/west theme and exploring more about the Jaxen world. 

When the Wind Lords met the rabble in Rikila, told thru the story of long-lost brothers. 

Dex (name? Pimp? Pex?) is both a cat and cat-burgler. 

Biff (name? Biggs? Wiff? Wiphim? Wiffamek) is both a cat and catty. 

This is a good chance to get funny in fairly obvious ways, and have fun with a “Tale of Two Cities” kind of theme. 


Work the Jax-folk into their story, on both sides. 

Pex has a friendship with a Jax that is turning into a love story, or is it a lust story?. He thinks he has “turned” a Jax. A Jax has been programmed to infiltrate the Kahila underground and it has mistakenly hooked up with Pex instead, who is a lone ranger/anarcho—cowboy Robin Hood kind of thief.

Biggs had early training regarding Jax infiltration techniques and Jax technology. He knows a lot more about the true nature of the Created than most easterners do, but had little to no actual interaction with them in the Weyrlands. He becomes fascinated by Pex’s “friend”, and also develops an emotional (sexual?) attachment.  

This part of it becomes a complicated but very funny “Cyrano de Bergerac” kind of story-line.

            <Text>Introduce Mikel Moballeq, foreshadowing the long rise later near the conclusion of this act.

Here we learn much more about the Mobalbesq, their relationship to the Helioptic Center and to Biveroon, as well as with the other eastern provinces.

The Mobalbesq is the most sea-oriented of the Saskan Lands. They are fisher-folk and explorers. They are among the most skeptical when it comes to “known facts” regarding the edge of the world and so forth. Although larger bek-based, and the homeland of a variant version of Helioptic belief-systems, they tend to be much less antagonistic towards sints, southerners, and so on. 

In some ways, they are my “anarcho-communist” society-in-embryo.

Along with Mikel’s story (see his bio), this section needs to develop the relationship of PSQ, Showan Biver-Wing and Birakey. 

And show how PSQ’s engineering work was supported by, encouraged by the Mobalbesq leaders, among others. 

Here’s the thing — I want to re-frame the entire central story-line using “The Great Debate”, which should be a like a trial organized by the Heliops to condemn PSQ’s investigations into  pollination, on the basis that they will lead to spreading the heretical belief in flight. 

The martyrdom of Henqu and Iohane makes for a dramatic opening, but even that is in the context of the fundamental challenge to Helioptic orthodoxy presented by PSQ’s findings on how to save all the beks and sints from annihilation. And then there is another layer to it, a good twist hopefully, where we find that the a very influential Agency Vice-Regent is backing the Helioptic side because PSQ’s work will also eventually uncover the true nature of the Enclosure. </Text>

In timeline, news of the rising and the trial has had time to percolate around the Ring. We see how it affects these 3 characters.

Mysteries abound. Water flowing underground.

The Jaxen threat is explored in more detail.

The limits of the Enclosure are explored further, both physically and ideologically.

Probably more than one chapter. Need to be careful not to just make it a travelogue.



Introduce a whole bunch of secondary and generic characters, revolving loosely around Jesse K (name?) and CC (Calley Coola .. Name?)


(The southern Ring - Wye, Barqton, Biverton, Kunstol,Barbol, New Harvest (or maybe “Lavega”) 

As the greater journey starts to roll along from east to west, our various heroes and anti-heroes encounter numerous difficulties and some losses. Each explores the dark deep pool in their own way.

Exploring the death drive in some detail, they each pursue an impossible goal. Acting “as if” it all makes sense, against all sensibility.

The so-called Wind Lords (or, as Jesse K calls them, the “Windy Lords”) enter the picture for the first time. Explore some of the underground caverns of the western lands. Get the first glimpse both of where new solutions, new technologies might emerge from.

First glimpse of what the Enclosure really consists of.

A type of creature missing throughout the story so far appears -- those with wings.  

And the avionic sints have a messianic mythology focused on the Awakening of Cereb, a flying [snake]. The dragon allusions are so obvious. And everybody loves a dragon story. How can we make it fresh? 

Is there something to be gleaned from Chinese mythology perhaps? The Goddess of the Sea?

Continuing to explore the underground tunnels of the western lands, plans are revealed for gliders, kites, balloons, parachutes. All those kinds of things that have been carefully denigrated and misdirected by the Agents. 

For better or worse, everything that PSQ’s work alludes to seems to be confirmed. It is all in progress. Except for the key ingredient ==&gt; the flying pollinators.

Let’s get a bee, bat, moth, butterfly resuscitation theme going too. But keep it even more occluded, mysterious. 

Is it a Jaxen experiment gone awry? The clone-lover of Biggs and Pex starts a movement to actually collaborate with herbalists and Mobalbesqian engineers. 

The “Free Jax” movement develops.

Engineering bees (and maybe moths, butterflies, dragon flies, etc.) back into life, turning the “scary bugs” motif around in a fun surprise. The “aliens” (Agency) are a hopeless mess, they caused some of the main problems and support some of the most reactionary forces in the Lands.

            <Title>Tonedo of Romperondo</Title>
            <Text>Tonedo of Romperando
The Judge of Juuj
The Grand Watcher 

Age at start of story: 
60 something

Place of origin: 
Village of Romperando, in the northern part of Kahilabek. The village is located in a northeastern section of Kahilabek that was once part of the province of Tobaloon. It was ceded to the Kahila folk in the Settlement of Bryktool, at the conclusion of the period known to Heliops as The Trouble with the Kahila. This was the same Settlement that granted the woods south of Juuj, formerly claimed by the Kahila, to Juujal.

Location at start of story: 
Juuj

Role in Story
Tonedo is the main antagonist to PSQ (and others). He is the accuser who brings charges of heresy against the scientist, and by implication against all of Mobalbesq (and friends).  The chief driver of persecutions carried out at the Gleaming, and throughout the year. Head of what amounts to both the secret police and the department to protect virtue and punish vice, Tonedo is responsible for maintaining order in the Heliop lands, as well as for spreading the Heliop faith and combatting all forms of heresy.

He epitomizes puro disdain for sints and uses every opportunity to cast the many dire situations faced by inhabitants of the Saskan Lands as caused by the dire influence of the mixed population. He never ceases preaching of the dangers posed by “creatures of darkness” and so on.  

His ability to rile up the faithful is a major source of recruitment for the Watches, but also for the Volunteers. The invasions from the Lewshan Mountains play right into his hands. 

He is responsible for the executions of Iohane and Henqu at the beginning of the story, and for the assassination of Birakay later in the story.

Goal
To root out “hidden” sints from the Heliop strongholds and to expand the borders and safe zones surrounding them. To expose and combat “revisionist” views of Helioptic traditions as found, especially, in the Arguments put forward by Biverune and Mobalbesq thinkers — but also to draw a sharp line between Helioptic and “anti-solar” thinking, which is his way of criticizing the New Riders and the Eelani. 

His paranoia is such that it promotes the idea that any supposedly puro human who is not a devout Heliop is probably hiding their “starry” or “animal” nature. He is suspicious and critical of all “new thinking” and detests “new songs”.  He views gender expression as a weakness that must be endured under specific conditions. His armed retinue / house guard are all biological women.

He is often at odds with the more pragmatic elements of the Helioptic Center, who sensibly value their somewhat fragile, sometimes profitable alliance with the westerners, as well as the relative peace with the southeastern provinces, and have no desire to re-ignite either the old civil war or a new one.

Physical Description / Appearance
Severe, thin, balding. Very tall and very strong. Likes to use his long arms to great dramatic effect when speechifying. Has a hypnotic effect on people around him.

Speaks in a very proper Eebar that is occasionally inflected with hints of the Oober that many of his villagers spoke when he was a child. 

Personality
Unctuous in the extreme.  Hates everything. Disagrees with everything. Never encounters an argument he won’t disagree with. A bully. 

Fearful of everything and everybody. Paranoid. But at the same time convinced that he is not paranoid because (which is true) there really _are_ monsters out there, the “world” really is going to shit, and there really are “heretics” of all kinds surrounding the bishopric on all sides.

Occupation / Education / Training
His uncle was the chief judge of Juuj before him. He was trained from childhood in Helioptic Thought and Argument, entering the Scribes of the Noon-Day Sun at young age and quickly advancing to more senior positions.  Although his official position in the Guardians is not public, he is widely assumed to be the head of the Night Watch and the Speiclas. He also commands the [Internal Watch], a group devoted to ferreting out spies, infiltrators and so on, as well as keeping an eye on the level of devotion exhibited by Helioptic officials. 

He is erudite, well-versed in Saskan history, but from an extremely prejudiced Helioptic point of view. Can read and understand multiple languages, but is never heard to speak anything except proper Eebar.

Habits / Mannerisms
A devoted carnivore, he makes a point of eating animal flesh and relishing it, nearly to the point of obscenity. He is openly disdainful of people who openly express either male or female gender and adopts the Helioptic gender-neutral “look” in his dress.  

Is incapable of forming a loving relationship, something that has isolated him from his family. Occasionally has relations with members of his retinue, but is not known to have spawned a brood.

Background
One of his grandmothers was a coyote-sint, something that is well-known in the village, but kept secret as much as possible in Tonedo’s public life. This may explain some of his psychological make-up (self-hate). He may also have a mild power of suggestion. 


Views and Perceptions
- on art, museums, monuments, icons, representation
He is against everything, a true iconoclast. His distate for music and song is one of the things that make him unpopular even amongst the faithful.
- on enclosure, zookeeping, control, rescue, freedom &amp; necessity
He utterly rejects any suggestion of enclosure or agency activity as “starry” nonsense aimed at undermining the authority of the Helioptic Center and the denying the centrality of the Solar Power.  He sees recovery of the Lands as something that will happen once a sufficient number of its residents adopt the true thinking and cast away sinful ways.  A bit of a genocidal maniac.
- on big other, petit objet a, realness, death drives
The “sint-spawned” are his Devil, whom he perceives as responsible for bringing division and disobedience, resulting in “land-illness”. His desire is for a “pure land” that has been “cleansed” of “infiltrators”. He believes that Eebar correctly names the things of the world and of the mind, while other languages are “debased”. 
- on benevolence, difference, events
The Arguments of Biverune are a constant source of aggravation for Tonedo, who would like to see them all overturned. A vulgar ideologue, he has virtually no appreciation for either dialectic or evolution. His understanding of major events all focus on “victories” and “defeats” for the Helioptic Center. He is utterly ignorant of the ecological and biological problems that Engineer Quinn presents.
- on music
See above. He find Birakay, who considers himself a devout and devoted Heliop, and is a popular emmisary of “modern” Helioptic culture, to be a most dangerous person, “infected” with “bad tones”.
Internal Conflicts
A sadist.

External Conflicts

Specific Conflicts

- Love

- Ethics

- Self-Sacrifice

- Duty

- Healing

- Ecocide / Planetary healing


Theme
Not quite a Darth Vader theme. He is a good bit less “cosmic” than that, more pathetic than Wagnerian. Maybe something in the zone of that droning Arabic style of music, or maybe just some jangling of bells (and chains? Or tocsins/woodblocks?).
Other Notes

- Need to define in more detail what/who are “the Kahila”, as distinct from other southerners and easterners, and separately from their association with criminal organizations.

- Need to elaborate, if only for background, on the structure of the leading/controlling Helioptic organizations and personalities. 

- Generally speaking, I have a lot of protagonists and not very many antagonists. Lots of good guys, but not so many bad guys and the one I have tend to be vague, amorphous “others”. Need to use Tonedo as the foil, the tip of the spear, for the “bad” Heliops. When they are defeated in Act Three, we need to see his downfall.

            <Title>Beat Sheet</Title>
            <Text>This is an adaptation of Blake Snyder’s “Beat Sheet” for a successful screen play. My thought here isn’t to stick to it precisely (he insists on specific # of pages, with specific things on specific pages) — but to help craft the story in a dramatic, interesting direction.

The order of things seems pretty good to me. I should work on re-arranging my scenes as needed to align with this pattern.

The length of each “beat” is expressed as a percentage of the whole, rather than as a precise number of pages. Hoping this will help focus attention on where to tighten things up, where to expand. Percentage are out of 110%.  Because we also go the extra mile….

Roughly placing the scenes I’ve outlined so far to see if they can fit this pattern —&gt;


1. Opening Scene (1%)

ACT ONE
Celebrations

- Grab attention!  Introduce the problem resolved later.
- Introduce the main character
- Introduce at least several of the other main characters

Bar scene in Rikila will probably work, but need to…
- Have Barko meet several of the main characters in the pub.
- Put PSQ there.
	- He’s on his way to present his findings to the authorities in Juuj.
	- Show his flaws. 
	- Nobody believes or understands him.
	- He is socially inept.
	- He get “rescued” by his “sidekicks” — Showan and the Jax
- He gets overheard by the Watch, who report on him
- The order is put out to take him under guard.
	- Introduce Tonedo


2. Theme Stated (4.5%)

 Rich Tall Tales
 The Splendid Boys

- Pose a question or make a statement, probably TO PSQ, that will be the theme of the movie.
- Maybe this is after Barko and Kirill meet and encounter PSQ again as they’re leaving
- Work on their meeting as way to introduce some of the other main characters whom they are planning a trip to Morilly to meet…
- Bring in more of the background on PSQ — what is he doing here? What is his mission? 
- Hint at the B Story (which is basically “other threats” — Lewshan, Forg, Jaxen, barbarians)


3. Set-up (3.5%, building on 1 and 2)

Northward to Sorrow — PSQ is taken to Juuj, among other things
Holidays Among the Kahila — a cohort follows 

- Be sure to initiate some running gags and call-backs at this juncture
- The ineptitude of the “advanced aliens” (the Agency) should be a running joke
   - They never do solve anything
   - They can’t agree with each other
   - Their interventions may have done more harm than good
   - There is no clear plan in what they are doing
   - The Enclosure itself is full of holes


4. Catalyst (1%)

The Great Auction — synch this up with PSQ’s trial? 
- Make it punchier.
- Move more of the character development to the next section


5. Debate (11%, starting from 4 and ending on 6)

The Great Auction, continued. 
Into the Wye
 Legends of Masschawa
 Cool Cats  — Replace Dex with Showan (a Prince to his pauper cousin)  

- Make sure we’re focusing on supporting (or not) PSQ’s contentions 
	— can we save the world?  
    — If he is right, then what do we need to do to save the world?
    — Is that more important than the threat from Lewshan?

6. Break into Two (1%)

The Blessed Flames — similar to the Great Auction, synch this to arguments in the trial of PSQ.  The fate of Iohane and Henqu makes us fearful for PSQ’s life. We’ve learned that the Lands are in grave danger. We’re not sure yet which threat is the worst one. But now it’s clear that PSQ’s life is in danger.




7. B Story (1%)

ACT TWO
The Glorious Sky — splash page.

8. Fun and Games (23%, starting from 7 and ending on 9)

The Glorious Sky, continued
Sniffing Out the Problem
Mother Knows Best
A Quest for Madness
Rolling on the River

- We seem to be on an entirely different theme..
- Talking about flying, aliens, botany.
- A good place to introduce other characters
- The upside-down version of Act One.
- The Saskan Lands from the Kahila, Barbo, Mobalbesq, Wyish, Weyrlands, etc. POV
- The promise of the premise should show up here.. The movie poster refers to this.
   - The bunnies with guns
   - The problem with bugs
   - Aliens with problems of their own
- Question is —&gt; does our hero get lost in this part? 
   - If he is off in Juuj getting judged, then what are all these folks doing 
     in this story?
   - Do we need to spring him? 
   - Is Showan the real hero?
   - Need to figure this out.

Sailing on the Seas
Wing Island

- I like the movement in two directions.
- Maybe want to intersperse them rather than putting the sea voyage at the end

- Perhaps I need to pick two PSQ “avatars”, like representative heroes during this phase.
   — I think Showan and Kirill are my best bets. Send Kirill out to sea.

- What is Birakey doing during all of this?
- Likewise, who are my alternative villains? — “Jesse K”, introduce the assassin of Birakey (is it Bu’ruq?.. And who sets him up?), Mur’ray — another tragic villain.  Calley Coola.  
- Those tragic villains are all interesting. Probably just need to have like “night rider” kind of agents from the Center following/tracking our alt-heroes.
- The Jaxen should also represent a “true” villain — one that resonates deeply but doesn’t have to be spelled out too much. They are ALSO representative of science, of the new technology, and indeed they will assist in (re-)introducing pollination to the Lands. But their totally machine-based life forms should give pause.
- Luvcando , Monmar, Grim Malek, Rillbeck — villain-ish characters who aren’t really evil and are kind of dark-humor relief


9. Midpoint (1%)

Good Morning, Saskantinon!

- Raise the stakes and present a false victory.
- Move at least an image of the return of voyagers and the rallying of the Volunteers to here.



10. Bad Guys Close In (18%, starting from 9 and ending on 11)


Attack from all directions
Resistance comes to the rescue
Resistance fighters are betrayed
Resistance fighters are massacred
New Riders turn back the barbarians
Heliop volunteers and New Riders turn back the monsters
Tonedo launches his final Argument against PSQ


11. All is Lost (1%)

Birakey is assasinated
Tonedo wraps up his final Argument against PSQ

12. Dark Night of the Soul (7%, starting from 11 and ending on 13)

Werylands are nearly overrun. Help arrives from Aranzen. (twist — new characters revealed)
Riders oppose the persecution of PSQ
The south rises in revolt



13. Break into Three (1%)

ACT THREE
PSQ defends himself


14. Finale (20%, starting from 13 and ending on 15)

The Miners of Eelan - maybe even do a fun little historical retro here?
The Riders revolt
The Jaxen Renaissance
Rebellion in Bequahoek — yeah, this goes here
The air flotilla arrives in the Juuj
The Agency goes on as usual — nothing has really changed, they are still inept
PSQ is acquitted
Everyone unites to drive back the monsters


15. Final Image (1%)
Soon after, flying things appear throughout the lands, pollinating stuff
- We see PSQ helping to direct operations, or at least enjoying the sight of butterflies

CODA:
- Snek has stayed on Wing Island. CERB arises.

SECOND CODA:
- Jax Control is studying rocketry

            <Text>The borders of the world, that is, the “enclosure”, could be defined a bit better.
Not so sure I want the continent to be so large.
Think about re-drawing the “Mantemar” (world, continents) maps to reflect more clearly the boundaries of “the enclosure”. Need to identify where “Wing Island” is, and maybe some other items of interest for the sea voyage part of the story.

See attached sketch “Saskan_Lands_political” for the large-scale regions. 
Continue to work on names for things that will be fun, non-derivative, unique if possible and not too offensive in other languages. :-) 

Cape Cod, the Mass. Islands, Long Island and Block Island are called “The Outer Lands” by geologists in real life. I love that term. Since I want to model at least some aspects of the eastern provinces after this area, let’s steal the term “The Outer Lands”. Sounds cool and fits their role in the story/setting pretty well.

Reading the Bill Moyer interview with Joseph Campbell, he went into some detail about the mythical significance of the numbers 13 and 9. Twelve, of course, fits my narrative in a (chromatic) musical sense, along with various harmonic combinations. Even if such numerological combos are not an overt part of the story, it could be helpful to use some of them in constructing relationships between towns, regions, neighborhoods and so on. </Text>

The Nye Tribe has multiple great families, each of which has an estate that is responsible for their area. Probably want to break this up even further, reflecting various inheritance schemes and so on. Basically something like a hacienda system.

The “Runes of Bye”, similar in some ways to the Nye Lands, are divided into many segments based on tribe, clan, family. But the story is more diverse. There is not just one tribe. The “Bye” tribe was thought to be once, in ancient times, the lords of this entire region, and they left many runes instructing their descendents in good behavior. These can still be found throughout the region, but are difficult to decipher since they are written in an ancient language that is no longer in use.

Interpretation of the runes over many centuries led to the development of an extraordinarily legalistic and contentious society which manages to thrive, as much as any can in this world, by a never-ending process of dialectic and argument. 

Byever Town and Lake Bye (maybe that’ll change those names…) are far and away the greatest achievements of this region.  </Text>

            <Title>Summary</Title>
            <Text>A key part of my story. This is where Phoenix Quinn is from.

Like the other non-Kahila southern regions, Mobalbeq officially recognizes the suzerainty of the Heliopticon, contributes forces to the Volunteers, but promotes a variation of Helioptic Thought that is quite distinct from that of the Center.

Like nearby Nye Lands and Runes of Bye, this region has developed out of a clan structure. The Mobal family is still very influential, but politically and culturally the region has moved more in the direction of a democratic republic. 

Its connection to the sea is profound. Along with Terpinol on the Aran Sea, the Town of Selaron in Mobalbeq is not only a center for fishing and trade, but is one of the few “ports” to areas outside of the Enclosure, both in the sense of seafaring and as a place where characters from the Agency tend to “check in”.

            <Title>Summary</Title>
            <Text>The most remote of the Saskan regions considered to be part of or allied with Sasnkantinon, Arq only very nominally shows fealty to the Center, mainly as a way to avoid the kind of trouble that the Kahila regions have long had with the Helipticon.

Heavily populated by non-human and partly-human sints, Arq is similar in some ways to the Komikol and the Krbish Sea. What distinguishes it from those Border Lands is the willingness of its inhabitants to interact with, influence, and learn from the beqqua (humans).  In this sense, it similar to the Runes of Bye, but with a much greater non-human feeling to it.

Politically and culturally, the Arq Lands are pretty much an anarchist’s wet dream. There is no centralized control of anything and there are hundreds of independent villages, dens, warrens and so on who deal with each other in a more or less rational way without requiring much bureaucracy or ideology. 

The Town of Barqton — home of our narrator — is one of the smallest of the municipal entities in the Saskan Lands. Basically it is a very large encampment.

        <Document ID="340">
            <Title>Summary</Title>
            <Text>The Kahila Lands are inhabited by the Kahilafolk. Not exactly a tribe or clan, they are “free folk” who, at various times over the centuries, have rejected Helioptic Thinking entirely, likewise are not fond of the “lordship” and “protectorate” models of governance promoted in the western lands, and refuse to recognize the authority of either Juuj or Borded.

Choosing warfare rather than retreat, the Kahila fought openly with the Heliops for centuries, culminating in the decades-long and bloody “Kahila Wars” that resulted in the establishment, with more or less official borders, of the two Kahila enclaves: the Kahilakol and the Kahilabeq.

The deep forests of the Kahilakol have long been their deepest refuge. Difficult to penetrate and full of hidden enclaves, Helioptic Watchers and Volunteers long ago gave up trying to control it, choosing instead a policy of accommodation with Mobalbeq  in order to surround and isolate the Kahila stronghold. That was only partly successful, as the Kahila fought for and won the corridor to Bye, giving them relatively safe passage through the Runes to the Kahilabeq. And the eastern routes to the sea through Mobalbeq are, likewise, well-traveled by the Kahilafolk, generally without serious incidents.

The Kahilakol remains the most recalcitrant Kahila province, home to every type of rebel, including many basiji and batami groups. Supporting a wildly diverse population, and located quite close to the ancient Helioptic Center at Juuj, the persistence of the Kahilakol was one of the main reasons for the establishment of a new Helioptic Center at Beshquohoek during the Kahila Wars.

The Kahilabeq is a considerably larger province than the Kahilakol, and was the setting for much of the violence perpetrated by Helioptic forces before and during the Kahila Wars. Forests were denuded, villages burned, massacres occurred. While the resistance never died, the current population of the Kahilabeq is less obstreperous in its opposition to Helioptic control than their cohorts in the Kahilakol. While life is not easy anywhere in the Saskan Lands, the culture of the Kahilabeq is more similar to that of the other southern provinces. Bordering the [southern river], and located between the Flow Lands and the Runes of Bye, these days the Kahilabeq attracts more entrepreneurs than it does rebel groups.  

The region lies just south of the well-fortified Helioptic central regions. The Kahilabeq border with Tobalon is heavily guarded on both sides and remains fairly tense, with major Helioptic outposts along the way. There is a strip of land that is still claimed by both sides but presently occupied by the Heliopticon. It would directly connect the two Kahila regions and also passes very close to Beshquahoek. Some of the bloodiest battles of the Kahila Wars were fought in this area, with the Helioptic Volunteers ultimately seizing part of the corridor and establishing their new capital near it. 

Much of the political theater in Kahlibeq revolves around whether to support rebels in Kahilakol, or adopt something more like the legalistic approach to autonomy promoted by the Runists of Bye, or the cultural/identity distinctions often associated with the Mobal clans.  Like Kahilakol and Arq, there is little in the way of organized “government” in the Kahilabeq.  Though the Town of Brokilly, a major trading center on the southern river, exerts a lot of influence in the region — and its biggest merchants guilds could be considered something like a “leading council” — the independent spirit of the Kahilafolk still permeates the region, both in terms of open defiance of Helioptic (and Borded) norms, and in the sense of a determinedly anti-authoritarian culture.

            <Text>Still working on good names for this region.

I like the original name for the mountains themselves: the Krunkinotto.
“Oaknaught” or “Oaknot” just struck me as kind of evocative.

This is the most mountainous region of the “known” world. North of the Weirland, the peaks rise higher and higher and become nearly impassable. 

The “created” (Jaxen, etc.) dwell mainly underground and in caverns and canyons in this area, where they can mine for the materials they need to reproduce themselves. Huge fires and smoke sometimes rise from their forges, or if there has been an accident, but generally speaking they are more “Metropolis” than “Mordor”. 

The “Western Enclosure” (the “edge of the world” and so on) is said to be found just beyond the Krunkinotto.  Hard to say, since few travelers have ever survived a journey into the mountains.

The Jaxen are fiercely protective of their enclaves. They watch all movement in the area and will capture or kill any intruders if they can.

Though their actual population is not so large, due mainly to difficulties in managing consistent mobile power supplies (batteries), the underground world of the Jaxen is enormous and reaches into both the Weir Lands and Bordaloon. 

Reformed Jaxen, robots/clones tied to the infiltration units commonly sent into the Saskan Lands as servants to gather info, tend to cluster in the southern caverns and tunnels, closer to High Weir. This is where their work on mechanized pollination techniques is most advanced and their AI has begun to split off from the collective as it developed increased compassion due to long-term attention to the suffering of the sints, beks and animals. (try to think of some clever Linux jokes to name them)

Inhabitants of the northern caverns and tunnels (old hat Unix-y…)  are traditionally more tied to the “old AI”, which perceives humans, in particular, as a threat to survival of the planet. The back story here brings us into another angle regarding the Agency. The created were not simply leftovers from a failed human experiment eons ago (not just the “Terminator” storyline), but were (at least partly) the result of an earlier attempt by galaxy-traveling folk to usefully mine this planet. Perhaps the Agency was actually founded in order to correct the mistakes of these earlier missions?

            <Text>The Wesshewen are mostly arid wind-swept plains, a kind of “Mad Max” post-apocalyptic hellscape. But at least lots of grass grows there.

It is home to roving bands of barbarians, mainly human, but also some with powers, some mixed, and some wildly adapted animal species. 

From the perspective the Saskan Lands, the Wesshewen is —&gt; 

1) The source of annoying barbarian raids — worse in the past than in modern times, but still an on-going concern.
2) The source of meat. Hunting parties often travel into Wesshewen to bring home a variety of edible kills.
3) A potential area of expansion. Both Mabalbeq in the Borded Lands, and Norgyte in the Heliopticon proper, as well as Salotriza to some extent, were occupied by Saskan forces over the centuries and “cleansed” of barbarian influences.  These regions bordering Wesshewen still have a very militaristic/warrior culture and also home to the main prison encampments in the Saskan Lands.

The “northern Enclosure” is said to keep even-worse barbarians at bay somewhere to the north, though it is hard to say since the further north hunting parties travel, the less likely they are to return.

            <Text>Aranzen is the most highly cultured of the Border Lands. It is the only neighboring “Land” that is not considered to be full of “barbarians”, “creatures of the Sky”, and so on.

It is, however, considered by loyal Helioptic Thinkers, to be “untidy” and, well, just plain weird. 

Home to many mixed and powered folks, Aranzen has a large coastal border on the Aran Sea, facing south. There is some trade and travel between Aranzen and towns of Harvest, Barbol and especially Terpinol. 

The back-story is that Aranzen was founded, inhabited by refugees coming from the West, while the Saskan Lands were settled mostly by refugees from the North and East. The most apparent difference between the Saskan and Aran cultures is their language. While most of the Saskan languages bear some resemblance to each other, the Aran languages are utterly different.

Physically, the Aranzen folk — descended from refugees of all types — have the same level of diversity seen in most of the Saskan Lands, but with mixed physiologies being more common. 

It is commonly thought that the “Enclosure” surrounds Aranzen to the West and the South. In some versions of the mythology, sailing too far into the Aran Sea (as with the Krbish Sea) means falling off the edge of the world. </Text>
